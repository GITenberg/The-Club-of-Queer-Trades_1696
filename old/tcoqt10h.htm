<h2>The Club of Queer Trades</h2>

<h2><br>
 Chapter 1</h2>

<h3>The Tremendous Adventures of Major Brown</h3>

<p>Rabelais, or his wild illustrator Gustave Dore, must have
had<br>
 something to do with the designing of the things called flats
in<br>
 England and America. There is something entirely Gargantuan in
the<br>
 idea of economising space by piling houses on top of each
other,<br>
 front doors and all. And in the chaos and complexity of
those<br>
 perpendicular streets anything may dwell or happen, and it is
in<br>
 one of them, I believe, that the inquirer may find the offices
of<br>
 the Club of Queer Trades. It may be thought at the first
glance<br>
 that the name would attract and startle the passer-by, but
nothing<br>
 attracts or startles in these dim immense hives. The passer-by
is<br>
 only looking for his own melancholy destination, the
Montenegro<br>
 Shipping Agency or the London office of the Rutland Sentinel,
and<br>
 passes through the twilight passages as one passes through
the<br>
 twilight corridors of a dream. If the Thugs set up a
Strangers'<br>
 Assassination Company in one of the great buildings in
Norfolk<br>
 Street, and sent in a mild man in spectacles to answer
inquiries,<br>
 no inquiries would be made. And the Club of Queer Trades reigns
in<br>
 a great edifice hidden like a fossil in a mighty cliff of
fossils.</p>

<p><br>
 The nature of this society, such as we afterwards discovered it
to<br>
 be, is soon and simply told. It is an eccentric and Bohemian
Club,<br>
 of which the absolute condition of membership lies in this,
that<br>
 the candidate must have invented the method by which he earns
his<br>
 living. It must be an entirely new trade. The exact definition
of<br>
 this requirement is given in the two principal rules. First,
it<br>
 must not be a mere application or variation of an existing
trade.<br>
 Thus, for instance, the Club would not admit an insurance
agent<br>
 simply because instead of insuring men's furniture against
being<br>
 burnt in a fire, he insured, let us say, their trousers
against<br>
 being torn by a mad dog. The principle (as Sir Bradcock<br>
 Burnaby-Bradcock, in the extraordinarily eloquent and
soaring<br>
 speech to the club on the occasion of the question being raised
in<br>
 the Stormby Smith affair, said wittily and keenly) is the
same.<br>
 Secondly, the trade must be a genuine commercial source of
income,<br>
 the support of its inventor. Thus the Club would not receive a
man<br>
 simply because he chose to pass his days collecting broken
sardine<br>
 tins, unless he could drive a roaring trade in them.
Professor<br>
 Chick made that quite clear. And when one remembers what
Professor<br>
 Chick's own new trade was, one doesn't know whether to laugh
or<br>
 cry.</p>

<p>The discovery of this strange society was a curiously
refreshing<br>
 thing; to realize that there were ten new trades in the world
was<br>
 like looking at the first ship or the first plough. It made a
man<br>
 feel what he should feel, that he was still in the childhood
of<br>
 the world. That I should have come at last upon so singular a
body<br>
 was, I may say without vanity, not altogether singular, for I
have<br>
 a mania for belonging to as many societies as possible: I may
be<br>
 said to collect clubs, and I have accumulated a vast and
fantastic<br>
 variety of specimens ever since, in my audacious youth, I<br>
 collected the Athenaeum. At some future day, perhaps, I may
tell<br>
 tales of some of the other bodies to which I have belonged. I
will<br>
 recount the doings of the Dead Man's Shoes Society (that<br>
 superficially immoral, but darkly justifiable communion); I
will<br>
 explain the curious origin of the Cat and Christian, the name
of<br>
 which has been so shamefully misinterpreted; and the world
shall<br>
 know at last why the Institute of Typewriters coalesced with
the<br>
 Red Tulip League. Of the Ten Teacups, of course I dare not say
a<br>
 word. The first of my revelations, at any rate, shall be
concerned<br>
 with the Club of Queer Trades, which, as I have said, was one
of<br>
 this class, one which I was almost bound to come across sooner
or<br>
 later, because of my singular hobby. The wild youth of the<br>
 metropolis call me facetiously `The King of Clubs'. They also
call<br>
 me `The Cherub', in allusion to the roseate and youthful<br>
 appearance I have presented in my declining years. I only hope
the<br>
 spirits in the better world have as good dinners as I have.
But<br>
 the finding of the Club of Queer Trades has one very curious
thing<br>
 about it. The most curious thing about it is that it was not<br>
 discovered by me; it was discovered by my friend Basil Grant,
a<br>
 star-gazer, a mystic, and a man who scarcely stirred out of
his<br>
 attic.</p>

<p>Very few people knew anything of Basil; not because he was in
the<br>
 least unsociable, for if a man out of the street had walked
into<br>
 his rooms he would have kept him talking till morning. Few
people<br>
 knew him, because, like all poets, he could do without them;
he<br>
 welcomed a human face as he might welcome a sudden blend of
colour<br>
 in a sunset; but he no more felt the need of going out to
parties<br>
 than he felt the need of altering the sunset clouds. He lived in
a<br>
 queer and comfortable garret in the roofs of Lambeth. He was<br>
 surrounded by a chaos of things that were in odd contrast to
the<br>
 slums around him; old fantastic books, swords, armour--the
whole<br>
 dust-hole of romanticism. But his face, amid all these
quixotic<br>
 relics, appeared curiously keen and modern--a powerful,
legal<br>
 face. And no one but I knew who he was.</p>

<p>Long ago as it is, everyone remembers the terrible and
grotesque<br>
 scene that occurred in--, when one of the most acute and
forcible<br>
 of the English judges suddenly went mad on the bench. I had my
own<br>
 view of that occurrence; but about the facts themselves there
is<br>
 no question at all. For some months, indeed for some years,
people<br>
 had detected something curious in the judge's conduct. He
seemed<br>
 to have lost interest in the law, in which he had been
beyond<br>
 expression brilliant and terrible as a K.C., and to be occupied
in<br>
 giving personal and moral advice to the people concerned. He<br>
 talked more like a priest or a doctor, and a very outspoken one
at<br>
 that. The first thrill was probably given when he said to a
man<br>
 who had attempted a crime of passion: "I sentence you to
three<br>
 years imprisonment, under the firm, and solemn, and
God-given<br>
 conviction, that what you require is three months at the
seaside."<br>
 He accused criminals from the bench, not so much of their
obvious<br>
 legal crimes, but of things that had never been heard of in
a<br>
 court of justice, monstrous egoism, lack of humour, and
morbidity<br>
 deliberately encouraged. Things came to a head in that
celebrated<br>
 diamond case in which the Prime Minister himself, that
brilliant<br>
 patrician, had to come forward, gracefully and reluctantly,
to<br>
 give evidence against his valet. After the detailed life of
the<br>
 household had been thoroughly exhibited, the judge requested
the<br>
 Premier again to step forward, which he did with quiet
dignity.<br>
 The judge then said, in a sudden, grating voice: "Get a new
soul.<br>
 That thing's not fit for a dog. Get a new soul." All this,
of<br>
 course, in the eyes of the sagacious, was premonitory of
that<br>
 melancholy and farcical day when his wits actually deserted
him<br>
 in open court. It was a libel case between two very eminent
and<br>
 powerful financiers, against both of whom charges of
considerable<br>
 defalcation were brought. The case was long and complex; the<br>
 advocates were long and eloquent; but at last, after weeks
of<br>
 work and rhetoric, the time came for the great judge to give
a<br>
 summing-up; and one of his celebrated masterpieces of
lucidity<br>
 and pulverizing logic was eagerly looked for. He had spoken
very<br>
 little during the prolonged affair, and he looked sad and
lowering<br>
 at the end of it. He was silent for a few moments, and then
burst<br>
 into a stentorian song. His remarks (as reported) were as
follows:</p>

<p>"O Rowty-owty tiddly-owty Tiddly-owty tiddly-owty
Highty-ighty<br>
 tiddly-ighty Tiddly-ighty ow."</p>

<p>He then retired from public life and took the garret in
Lambeth.</p>

<p>I was sitting there one evening, about six o'clock, over a
glass of<br>
 that gorgeous Burgundy which he kept behind a pile of
black-letter<br>
 folios; he was striding about the room, fingering, after a habit
of<br>
 his, one of the great swords in his collection; the red glare
of<br>
 the strong fire struck his square features and his fierce
grey<br>
 hair; his blue eyes were even unusually full of dreams, and he
had<br>
 opened his mouth to speak dreamily, when the door was flung
open,<br>
 and a pale, fiery man, with red hair and a huge furred
overcoat,<br>
 swung himself panting into the room.</p>

<p>"Sorry to bother you, Basil," he gasped. "I took a
liberty--made an<br>
 appointment here with a man--a client--in five minutes--I beg
your<br>
 pardon, sir," and he gave me a bow of apology.</p>

<p>Basil smiled at me. "You didn't know," he said, "that I had
a<br>
 practical brother. This is Rupert Grant, Esquire, who can and
does<br>
 all there is to be done. Just as I was a failure at one thing,
he<br>
 is a success at everything. I remember him as a journalist,
a<br>
 house-agent, a naturalist, an inventor, a publisher, a<br>
 schoolmaster, a--what are you now, Rupert?"</p>

<p>"I am and have been for some time," said Rupert, with some
dignity,<br>
 "a private detective, and there's my client."</p>

<p>A loud rap at the door had cut him short, and, on permission
being<br>
 given, the door was thrown sharply open and a stout, dapper
man<br>
 walked swiftly into the room, set his silk hat with a clap on
the<br>
 table, and said, "Good evening, gentlemen," with a stress on
the<br>
 last syllable that somehow marked him out as a martinet,
military,<br>
 literary and social. He had a large head streaked with black
and<br>
 grey, and an abrupt black moustache, which gave him a look
of<br>
 fierceness which was contradicted by his sad sea-blue eyes.</p>

<p>Basil immediately said to me, "Let us come into the next
room,<br>
 Gully," and was moving towards the door, but the stranger
said:</p>

<p>"Not at all. Friends remain. Assistance possibly."</p>

<p>The moment I heard him speak I remembered who he was, a
certain<br>
 Major Brown I had met years before in Basil's society. I had<br>
 forgotten altogether the black dandified figure and the
large<br>
 solemn head, but I remembered the peculiar speech, which
consisted<br>
 of only saying about a quarter of each sentence, and that
sharply,<br>
 like the crack of a gun. I do not know, it may have come
from<br>
 giving orders to troops.</p>

<p>Major Brown was a V.C., and an able and distinguished soldier,
but<br>
 he was anything but a warlike person. Like many among the iron
men<br>
 who recovered British India, he was a man with the natural
beliefs<br>
 and tastes of an old maid. In his dress he was dapper and
yet<br>
 demure; in his habits he was precise to the point of the
exact<br>
 adjustment of a tea-cup. One enthusiasm he had, which was of
the<br>
 nature of a religion--the cultivation of pansies. And when
he<br>
 talked about his collection, his blue eyes glittered like a
child's<br>
 at a new toy, the eyes that had remained untroubled when the
troops<br>
 were roaring victory round Roberts at Candahar.</p>

<p>"Well, Major," said Rupert Grant, with a lordly
heartiness,<br>
 flinging himself into a chair, "what is the matter with
you?"</p>

<p>"Yellow pansies. Coal-cellar. P. G. Northover," said the
Major,<br>
 with righteous indignation.</p>

<p>We glanced at each other with inquisitiveness. Basil, who had
his<br>
 eyes shut in his abstracted way, said simply:</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon."</p>

<p>"Fact is. Street, you know, man, pansies. On wall. Death to
me.<br>
 Something. Preposterous."</p>

<p>We shook our heads gently. Bit by bit, and mainly by the
seemingly<br>
 sleepy assistance of Basil Grant, we pieced together the
Major's<br>
 fragmentary, but excited narration. It would be infamous to
submit<br>
 the reader to what we endured; therefore I will tell the story
of<br>
 Major Brown in my own words. But the reader must imagine the<br>
 scene. The eyes of Basil closed as in a trance, after his
habit,<br>
 and the eyes of Rupert and myself getting rounder and rounder
as<br>
 we listened to one of the most astounding stories in the
world,<br>
 from the lips of the little man in black, sitting bolt upright
in<br>
 his chair and talking like a telegram.</p>

<p>Major Brown was, I have said, a successful soldier, but by
no<br>
 means an enthusiastic one. So far from regretting his
retirement<br>
 on half-pay, it was with delight that he took a small neat
villa,<br>
 very like a doll's house, and devoted the rest of his life
to<br>
 pansies and weak tea. The thought that battles were over when
he<br>
 had once hung up his sword in the little front hall (along
with<br>
 two patent stew-pots and a bad water-colour), and betaken
himself<br>
 instead to wielding the rake in his little sunlit garden, was
to<br>
 him like having come into a harbour in heaven. He was
Dutch-like<br>
 and precise in his taste in gardening, and had, perhaps,
some<br>
 tendency to drill his flowers like soldiers. He was one of
those<br>
 men who are capable of putting four umbrellas in the stand
rather<br>
 than three, so that two may lean one way and two another; he
saw<br>
 life like a pattern in a freehand drawing-book. And assuredly
he<br>
 would not have believed, or even understood, any one who had
told<br>
 him that within a few yards of his brick paradise he was
destined<br>
 to be caught in a whirlpool of incredible adventure, such as
he<br>
 had never seen or dreamed of in the horrible jungle, or the
heat<br>
 of battle.</p>

<p>One certain bright and windy afternoon, the Major, attired in
his<br>
 usual faultless manner, had set out for his usual
constitutional.<br>
 In crossing from one great residential thoroughfare to another,
he<br>
 happened to pass along one of those aimless-looking lanes which
lie<br>
 along the back-garden walls of a row of mansions, and which
in<br>
 their empty and discoloured appearance give one an odd sensation
as<br>
 of being behind the scenes of a theatre. But mean and sulky as
the<br>
 scene might be in the eyes of most of us, it was not altogether
so<br>
 in the Major's, for along the coarse gravel footway was coming
a<br>
 thing which was to him what the passing of a religious
procession<br>
 is to a devout person. A large, heavy man, with fish-blue eyes
and<br>
 a ring of irradiating red beard, was pushing before him a
barrow,<br>
 which was ablaze with incomparable flowers. There were
splendid<br>
 specimens of almost every order, but the Major's own
favourite<br>
 pansies predominated. The Major stopped and fell into
conversation,<br>
 and then into bargaining. He treated the man after the manner
of<br>
 collectors and other mad men, that is to say, he carefully and
with<br>
 a sort of anguish selected the best roots from the less
excellent,<br>
 praised some, disparaged others, made a subtle scale ranging
from a<br>
 thrilling worth and rarity to a degraded insignificance, and
then<br>
 bought them all. The man was just pushing off his barrow when
he<br>
 stopped and came close to the Major.</p>

<p>"I'll tell you what, sir," he said. "If you're interested in
them<br>
 things, you just get on to that wall."</p>

<p>"On the wall!" cried the scandalised Major, whose conventional
soul<br>
 quailed within him at the thought of such fantastic
trespass.</p>

<p>"Finest show of yellow pansies in England in that there
garden,<br>
 sir," hissed the tempter. "I'll help you up, sir."</p>

<p>How it happened no one will ever know but that positive
enthusiasm<br>
 of the Major's life triumphed over all its negative
traditions,<br>
 and with an easy leap and swing that showed that he was in no
need<br>
 of physical assistance, he stood on the wall at the end of
the<br>
 strange garden. The second after, the flapping of the
frock-coat<br>
 at his knees made him feel inexpressibly a fool. But the
next<br>
 instant all such trifling sentiments were swallowed up by the
most<br>
 appalling shock of surprise the old soldier had ever felt in
all<br>
 his bold and wandering existence. His eyes fell upon the
garden,<br>
 and there across a large bed in the centre of the lawn was a
vast<br>
 pattern of pansies; they were splendid flowers, but for once
it<br>
 was not their horticultural aspects that Major Brown beheld,
for<br>
 the pansies were arranged in gigantic capital letters so as
to<br>
 form the sentence:</p>

<h3>DEATH TO MAJOR BROWN</h3>

<p>A kindly looking old man, with white whiskers, was watering
them.<br>
 Brown looked sharply back at the road behind him; the man with
the<br>
 barrow had suddenly vanished. Then he looked again at the
lawn<br>
 with its incredible inscription. Another man might have thought
he<br>
 had gone mad, but Brown did not. When romantic ladies gushed
over<br>
 his V.C. and his military exploits, he sometimes felt himself
to<br>
 be a painfully prosaic person, but by the same token he knew
he<br>
 was incurably sane. Another man, again, might have thought
himself<br>
 a victim of a passing practical joke, but Brown could not
easily<br>
 believe this. He knew from his own quaint learning that the
garden<br>
 arrangement was an elaborate and expensive one; he thought
it<br>
 extravagantly improbable that any one would pour out money
like<br>
 water for a joke against him. Having no explanation whatever
to<br>
 offer, he admitted the fact to himself, like a clear-headed
man,<br>
 and waited as he would have done in the presence of a man with
six<br>
 legs.</p>

<p><br>
 At this moment the stout old man with white whiskers looked up,
and<br>
 the watering can fell from his hand, shooting a swirl of water
down<br>
 the gravel path.</p>

<p>"Who on earth are you?" he gasped, trembling violently.</p>

<p>"I am Major Brown," said that individual, who was always cool
in<br>
 the hour of action.</p>

<p>The old man gaped helplessly like some monstrous fish. At last
he<br>
 stammered wildly, "Come down--come down here!"</p>

<p>"At your service," said the Major, and alighted at a bound on
the<br>
 grass beside him, without disarranging his silk hat.</p>

<p>The old man turned his broad back and set off at a sort of
waddling<br>
 run towards the house, followed with swift steps by the Major.
His<br>
 guide led him through the back passages of a gloomy, but
gorgeously<br>
 appointed house, until they reached the door of the front
room.<br>
 Then the old man turned with a face of apoplectic terror
dimly<br>
 showing in the twilight.</p>

<p>"For heaven's sake," he said, "don't mention jackals."</p>

<p>Then he threw open the door, releasing a burst of red
lamplight,<br>
 and ran downstairs with a clatter.</p>

<p>The Major stepped into a rich, glowing room, full of red
copper,<br>
 and peacock and purple hangings, hat in hand. He had the
finest<br>
 manners in the world, and, though mystified, was not in the
least<br>
 embarrassed to see that the only occupant was a lady, sitting
by<br>
 the window, looking out.</p>

<p>"Madam," he said, bowing simply, "I am Major Brown."</p>

<p>"Sit down," said the lady; but she did not turn her head.</p>

<p>She was a graceful, green-clad figure, with fiery red hair and
a<br>
 flavour of Bedford Park. "You have come, I suppose," she
said<br>
 mournfully, "to tax me about the hateful title-deeds."</p>

<p>"I have come, madam," he said, "to know what is the matter. To
know<br>
 why my name is written across your garden. Not amicably
either."</p>

<p>He spoke grimly, for the thing had hit him. It is impossible
to<br>
 describe the effect produced on the mind by that quiet and
sunny<br>
 garden scene, the frame for a stunning and brutal
personality.<br>
 The evening air was still, and the grass was golden in the
place<br>
 where the little flowers he studied cried to heaven for his<br>
 blood.</p>

<p>"You know I must not turn round," said the lady; "every
afternoon<br>
 till the stroke of six I must keep my face turned to the
street."</p>

<p>Some queer and unusual inspiration made the prosaic
soldier<br>
 resolute to accept these outrageous riddles without
surprise.</p>

<p>"It is almost six," he said; and even as he spoke the
barbaric<br>
 copper clock upon the wall clanged the first stroke of the
hour.<br>
 At the sixth the lady sprang up and turned on the Major one
of<br>
 the queerest and yet most attractive faces he had ever seen
in<br>
 his life; open, and yet tantalising, the face of an elf.</p>

<p>"That makes the third year I have waited," she cried. "This is
an<br>
 anniversary. The waiting almost makes one wish the frightful
thing<br>
 would happen once and for all."</p>

<p>And even as she spoke, a sudden rending cry broke the
stillness.<br>
 From low down on the pavement of the dim street (it was
already<br>
 twilight) a voice cried out with a raucous and merciless<br>
 distinctness:</p>

<p>"Major Brown, Major Brown, where does the jackal dwell?"</p>

<p>Brown was decisive and silent in action. He strode to the
front<br>
 door and looked out. There was no sign of life in the blue
gloaming<br>
 of the street, where one or two lamps were beginning to light
their<br>
 lemon sparks. On returning, he found the lady in green
trembling.</p>

<p>"It is the end," she cried, with shaking lips; "it may be
death for<br>
 both of us. Whenever--"</p>

<p>But even as she spoke her speech was cloven by another
hoarse<br>
 proclamation from the dark street, again horribly
articulate.</p>

<p>"Major Brown, Major Brown, how did the jackal die?"</p>

<p>Brown dashed out of the door and down the steps, but again he
was<br>
 frustrated; there was no figure in sight, and the street was
far<br>
 too long and empty for the shouter to have run away. Even
the<br>
 rational Major was a little shaken as he returned in a certain
time<br>
 to the drawing-room. Scarcely had he done so than the
terrific<br>
 voice came:</p>

<p>"Major Brown, Major Brown, where did--"</p>

<p>Brown was in the street almost at a bound, and he was in
time--in<br>
 time to see something which at first glance froze the blood.
The<br>
 cries appeared to come from a decapitated head resting on
the<br>
 pavement.</p>

<p>The next moment the pale Major understood. It was the head of
a<br>
 man thrust through the coal-hole in the street. The next
moment,<br>
 again, it had vanished, and Major Brown turned to the lady.<br>
 "Where's your coal-cellar?" he said, and stepped out into
the<br>
 passage.</p>

<p>She looked at him with wild grey eyes. "You will not go down,"
she<br>
 cried, "alone, into the dark hole, with that beast?"</p>

<p>"Is this the way?" replied Brown, and descended the kitchen
stairs<br>
 three at a time. He flung open the door of a black cavity
and<br>
 stepped in, feeling in his pocket for matches. As his right
hand<br>
 was thus occupied, a pair of great slimy hands came out of
the<br>
 darkness, hands clearly belonging to a man of gigantic
stature,<br>
 and seized him by the back of the head. They forced him down,
down<br>
 in the suffocating darkness, a brutal image of destiny. But
the<br>
 Major's head, though upside down, was perfectly clear and<br>
 intellectual. He gave quietly under the pressure until he had
slid<br>
 down almost to his hands and knees. Then finding the knees of
the<br>
 invisible monster within a foot of him, he simply put out one
of<br>
 his long, bony, and skilful hands, and gripping the leg by a<br>
 muscle pulled it off the ground and laid the huge living man,
with<br>
 a crash, along the floor. He strove to rise, but Brown was on
top<br>
 like a cat. They rolled over and over. Big as the man was, he
had<br>
 evidently now no desire but to escape; he made sprawls hither
and<br>
 thither to get past the Major to the door, but that
tenacious<br>
 person had him hard by the coat collar and hung with the
other<br>
 hand to a beam. At length there came a strain in holding back
this<br>
 human bull, a strain under which Brown expected his hand to
rend<br>
 and part from the arm. But something else rent and parted; and
the<br>
 dim fat figure of the giant vanished out of the cellar,
leaving<br>
 the torn coat in the Major's hand; the only fruit of his
adventure<br>
 and the only clue to the mystery. For when he went up and out
at<br>
 the front door, the lady, the rich hangings, and the whole<br>
 equipment of the house had disappeared. It had only bare
boards<br>
 and whitewashed walls.</p>

<p>"The lady was in the conspiracy, of course," said Rupert,
nodding.<br>
 Major Brown turned brick red. "I beg your pardon," he said,
"I<br>
 think not."</p>

<p>Rupert raised his eyebrows and looked at him for a moment, but
said<br>
 nothing. When next he spoke he asked:</p>

<p>"Was there anything in the pockets of the coat?"</p>

<p>"There was sevenpence halfpenny in coppers and a
threepenny-bit,"<br>
 said the Major carefully; "there was a cigarette-holder, a piece
of<br>
 string, and this letter," and he laid it on the table. It ran
as<br>
 follows:</p>

<p>Dear Mr Plover,</p>

<p>I am annoyed to hear that some delay has occurred in the<br>
 arrangements re Major Brown. Please see that he is attacked
as<br>
 per arrangement tomorrow The coal-cellar, of course.</p>

<p>Yours faithfully, P. G. Northover.</p>

<p>Rupert Grant was leaning forward listening with hawk-like
eyes. He<br>
 cut in:</p>

<p>"Is it dated from anywhere?"</p>

<p>"No--oh, yes!" replied Brown, glancing upon the paper; "14
Tanner's<br>
 Court, North--"</p>

<p>Rupert sprang up and struck his hands together.</p>

<p>"Then why are we hanging here? Let's get along. Basil, lend me
your<br>
 revolver."</p>

<p>Basil was staring into the embers like a man in a trance; and
it<br>
 was some time before he answered:</p>

<p>"I don't think you'll need it."</p>

<p>"Perhaps not," said Rupert, getting into his fur coat. "One
never<br>
 knows. But going down a dark court to see criminals--"</p>

<p>"Do you think they are criminals?" asked his brother.</p>

<p>Rupert laughed stoutly. "Giving orders to a subordinate to
strangle<br>
 a harmless stranger in a coal-cellar may strike you as a
very<br>
 blameless experiment, but--"</p>

<p>"Do you think they wanted to strangle the Major?" asked Basil,
in<br>
 the same distant and monotonous voice.</p>

<p>"My dear fellow, you've been asleep. Look at the letter."</p>

<p>"I am looking at the letter," said the mad judge calmly;
though, as<br>
 a matter of fact, he was looking at the fire. "I don't think
it's<br>
 the sort of letter one criminal would write to another."</p>

<p>"My dear boy, you are glorious," cried Rupert, turning round,
with<br>
 laughter in his blue bright eyes. "Your methods amaze me.
Why,<br>
 there is the letter. It is written, and it does give orders for
a<br>
 crime. You might as well say that the Nelson Column was not at
all<br>
 the sort of thing that was likely to be set up in Trafalgar<br>
 Square."</p>

<p>Basil Grant shook all over with a sort of silent laughter, but
did<br>
 not otherwise move.</p>

<p>"That's rather good," he said; "but, of course, logic like
that's<br>
 not what is really wanted. It's a question of spiritual
atmosphere.<br>
 It's not a criminal letter."</p>

<p>"It is. It's a matter of fact," cried the other in an agony
of<br>
 reasonableness.</p>

<p>"Facts," murmured Basil, like one mentioning some strange,
far-off<br>
 animals, "how facts obscure the truth. I may be silly--in
fact,<br>
 I'm off my head--but I never could believe in that man--what's
his<br>
 name, in those capital stories?--Sherlock Holmes. Every
detail<br>
 points to something, certainly; but generally to the wrong
thing.<br>
 Facts point in all directions, it seems to me, like the
thousands<br>
 of twigs on a tree. It's only the life of the tree that has
unity<br>
 and goes up--only the green blood that springs, like a
fountain,<br>
 at the stars."</p>

<p>"But what the deuce else can the letter be but criminal?"</p>

<p>"We have eternity to stretch our legs in," replied the mystic.
"It<br>
 can be an infinity of things. I haven't seen any of
them--I've<br>
 only seen the letter. I look at that, and say it's not
criminal."</p>

<p>"Then what's the origin of it?"</p>

<p>"I haven't the vaguest idea."</p>

<p>"Then why don't you accept the ordinary explanation?"</p>

<p>Basil continued for a little to glare at the coals, and
seemed<br>
 collecting his thoughts in a humble and even painful way. Then
he<br>
 said:</p>

<p>"Suppose you went out into the moonlight. Suppose you
passed<br>
 through silent, silvery streets and squares until you came into
an<br>
 open and deserted space, set with a few monuments, and you
beheld<br>
 one dressed as a ballet girl dancing in the argent glimmer.
And<br>
 suppose you looked, and saw it was a man disguised. And
suppose<br>
 you looked again, and saw it was Lord Kitchener. What would
you<br>
 think?"</p>

<p>He paused a moment, and went on:</p>

<p>"You could not adopt the ordinary explanation. The
ordinary<br>
 explanation of putting on singular clothes is that you look
nice<br>
 in them; you would not think that Lord Kitchener dressed up like
a<br>
 ballet girl out of ordinary personal vanity. You would think
it<br>
 much more likely that he inherited a dancing madness from a
great<br>
 grandmother; or had been hypnotised at a seance; or threatened
by<br>
 a secret society with death if he refused the ordeal. With<br>
 Baden-Powell, say, it might be a bet--but not with Kitchener.
I<br>
 should know all that, because in my public days I knew him
quite<br>
 well. So I know that letter quite well, and criminals quite
well.<br>
 It's not a criminal's letter. It's all atmospheres." And he
closed<br>
 his eyes and passed his hand over his forehead.</p>

<p>Rupert and the Major were regarding him with a mixture of
respect<br>
 and pity. The former said</p>

<p>"Well, I'm going, anyhow, and shall continue to think--until
your<br>
 spiritual mystery turns up--that a man who sends a note<br>
 recommending a crime, that is, actually a crime that is
actually<br>
 carried out, at least tentatively, is, in all probability, a<br>
 little casual in his moral tastes. Can I have that
revolver?"</p>

<p>"Certainly," said Basil, getting up. "But I am coming with
you."<br>
 And he flung an old cape or cloak round him, and took a<br>
 sword-stick from the corner.</p>

<p>"You!" said Rupert, with some surprise, "you scarcely ever
leave<br>
 your hole to look at anything on the face of the earth."</p>

<p>Basil fitted on a formidable old white hat.</p>

<p>"I scarcely ever," he said, with an unconscious and
colossal<br>
 arrogance, "hear of anything on the face of the earth that I
do<br>
 not understand at once, without going to see it."</p>

<p>And he led the way out into the purple night.</p>

<p>We four swung along the flaring Lambeth streets, across
Westminster<br>
 Bridge, and along the Embankment in the direction of that part
of<br>
 Fleet Street which contained Tanner's Court. The erect,
black<br>
 figure of Major Brown, seen from behind, was a quaint contrast
to<br>
 the hound-like stoop and flapping mantle of young Rupert Grant,
who<br>
 adopted, with childlike delight, all the dramatic poses of
the<br>
 detective of fiction. The finest among his many fine qualities
was<br>
 his boyish appetite for the colour and poetry of London. Basil,
who<br>
 walked behind, with his face turned blindly to the stars, had
the<br>
 look of a somnambulist.</p>

<p>Rupert paused at the corner of Tanner's Court, with a quiver
of<br>
 delight at danger, and gripped Basil's revolver in his
great-coat<br>
 pocket.</p>

<p>"Shall we go in now?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Not get police?" asked Major Brown, glancing sharply up and
down<br>
 the street.</p>

<p>"I am not sure," answered Rupert, knitting his brows. "Of
course,<br>
 it's quite clear, the thing's all crooked. But there are three
of<br>
 us, and--"</p>

<p>"I shouldn't get the police," said Basil in a queer voice.
Rupert<br>
 glanced at him and stared hard.</p>

<p>"Basil," he cried, "you're trembling. What's the matter--are
you<br>
 afraid?"</p>

<p>"Cold, perhaps," said the Major, eyeing him. There was no
doubt<br>
 that he was shaking.</p>

<p>At last, after a few moments' scrutiny, Rupert broke into a
curse.</p>

<p>"You're laughing," he cried. "I know that confounded,
silent,<br>
 shaky laugh of yours. What the deuce is the amusement,
Basil?<br>
 Here we are, all three of us, within a yard of a den of<br>
 ruffians--"</p>

<p>"But I shouldn't call the police," said Basil. "We four
heroes<br>
 are quite equal to a host," and he continued to quake with
his<br>
 mysterious mirth.</p>

<p>Rupert turned with impatience and strode swiftly down the
court,<br>
 the rest of us following. When he reached the door of No. 14
he<br>
 turned abruptly, the revolver glittering in his hand.</p>

<p>"Stand close," he said in the voice of a commander. "The
scoundrel<br>
 may be attempting an escape at this moment. We must fling open
the<br>
 door and rush in."</p>

<p>The four of us cowered instantly under the archway, rigid,
except<br>
 for the old judge and his convulsion of merriment.</p>

<p>"Now," hissed Rupert Grant, turning his pale face and burning
eyes<br>
 suddenly over his shoulder, "when I say `Four', follow me with
a<br>
 rush. If I say `Hold him', pin the fellows down, whoever they
are.<br>
 If I say `Stop', stop. I shall say that if there are more
than<br>
 three. If they attack us I shall empty my revolver on them.
Basil,<br>
 have your sword-stick ready. Now--one, two three, four!"</p>

<p>With the sound of the word the door burst open, and we fell
into<br>
 the room like an invasion, only to stop dead.</p>

<p>The room, which was an ordinary and neatly appointed
office,<br>
 appeared, at the first glance, to be empty. But on a second
and<br>
 more careful glance, we saw seated behind a very large desk
with<br>
 pigeonholes and drawers of bewildering multiplicity, a small
man<br>
 with a black waxed moustache, and the air of a very average
clerk,<br>
 writing hard. He looked up as we came to a standstill.</p>

<p>"Did you knock?" he asked pleasantly. "I am sorry if I did
not<br>
 hear. What can I do for you?"</p>

<p>There was a doubtful pause, and then, by general consent, the
Major<br>
 himself, the victim of the outrage, stepped forward.</p>

<p>The letter was in his hand, and he looked unusually grim.</p>

<p>"Is your name P. G. Northover?" he asked.</p>

<p>"That is my name," replied the other, smiling.</p>

<p>"I think," said Major Brown, with an increase in the dark glow
of<br>
 his face, "that this letter was written by you." And with a
loud<br>
 clap he struck open the letter on the desk with his clenched
fist.<br>
 The man called Northover looked at it with unaffected interest
and<br>
 merely nodded.</p>

<p>"Well, sir," said the Major, breathing hard, "what about
that?"</p>

<p>"What about it, precisely," said the man with the
moustache.</p>

<p>"I am Major Brown," said that gentleman sternly.</p>

<p>Northover bowed. "Pleased to meet you, sir. What have you to
say to<br>
 me?"</p>

<p>"Say!" cried the Major, loosing a sudden tempest; "why, I want
this<br>
 confounded thing settled. I want--"</p>

<p>"Certainly, sir," said Northover, jumping up with a slight<br>
 elevation of the eyebrows. "Will you take a chair for a
moment."<br>
 And he pressed an electric bell just above him, which thrilled
and<br>
 tinkled in a room beyond. The Major put his hand on the back of
the<br>
 chair offered him, but stood chafing and beating the floor with
his<br>
 polished boot.</p>

<p>The next moment an inner glass door was opened, and a fair,
weedy,<br>
 young man, in a frock-coat, entered from within.</p>

<p>"Mr Hopson," said Northover, "this is Major Brown. Will you
please<br>
 finish that thing for him I gave you this morning and bring it
in?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," said Mr Hopson, and vanished like lightning.</p>

<p>"You will excuse me, gentlemen," said the egregious Northover,
with<br>
 his radiant smile, "if I continue to work until Mr Hopson is
ready.<br>
 I have some books that must be cleared up before I get away on
my<br>
 holiday tomorrow. And we all like a whiff of the country, don't
we?<br>
 Ha! ha!"</p>

<p>The criminal took up his pen with a childlike laugh, and a<br>
 silence ensued; a placid and busy silence on the part of Mr P.
G.<br>
 Northover; a raging silence on the part of everybody else.</p>

<p>At length the scratching of Northover's pen in the stillness
was<br>
 mingled with a knock at the door, almost simultaneous with
the<br>
 turning of the handle, and Mr Hopson came in again with the
same<br>
 silent rapidity, placed a paper before his principal, and<br>
 disappeared again.</p>

<p>The man at the desk pulled and twisted his spiky moustache for
a<br>
 few moments as he ran his eye up and down the paper presented
to<br>
 him. He took up his pen, with a slight, instantaneous frown,
and<br>
 altered something, muttering--"Careless." Then he read it
again<br>
 with the same impenetrable reflectiveness, and finally handed
it<br>
 to the frantic Brown, whose hand was beating the devil's
tattoo<br>
 on the back of the chair.</p>

<p>"I think you will find that all right, Major," he said
briefly.</p>

<p>The Major looked at it; whether he found it all right or not
will<br>
 appear later, but he found it like this:</p>

<p><br>
 "What," said Brown, after a dead pause, and with eyes that
seemed<br>
 slowly rising out of his head, "What in heaven's name is
this?"</p>

<p>"What is it?" repeated Northover, cocking his eyebrow with<br>
 amusement. "It's your account, of course."</p>

<p>"My account!" The Major's ideas appeared to be in a vague
stampede.<br>
 "My account! And what have I got to do with it?"</p>

<p>"Well," said Northover, laughing outright, "naturally I prefer
you<br>
 to pay it."</p>

<p>The Major's hand was still resting on the back of the chair as
the<br>
 words came. He scarcely stirred otherwise, but he lifted the
chair<br>
 bodily into the air with one hand and hurled it at
Northover's<br>
 head.</p>

<p>The legs crashed against the desk, so that Northover only got
a<br>
 blow on the elbow as he sprang up with clenched fists, only to
be<br>
 seized by the united rush of the rest of us. The chair had
fallen<br>
 clattering on the empty floor.</p>

<p>"Let me go, you scamps," he shouted. "Let me--"</p>

<p>"Stand still," cried Rupert authoritatively. "Major Brown's
action<br>
 is excusable. The abominable crime you have attempted--"</p>

<p>"A customer has a perfect right," said Northover hotly,
"to<br>
 question an alleged overcharge, but, confound it all, not to
throw<br>
 furniture."</p>

<p>"What, in God's name, do you mean by your customers and<br>
 overcharges?" shrieked Major Brown, whose keen feminine
nature,<br>
 steady in pain or danger, became almost hysterical in the
presence<br>
 of a long and exasperating mystery. "Who are you? I've never
seen<br>
 you or your insolent tomfool bills. I know one of your
cursed<br>
 brutes tried to choke me--"</p>

<p>"Mad," said Northover, gazing blankly round; "all of them mad.
I<br>
 didn't know they travelled in quartettes."</p>

<p>"Enough of this prevarication," said Rupert; "your crimes
are<br>
 discovered. A policeman is stationed at the corner of the
court.<br>
 Though only a private detective myself, I will take the<br>
 responsibility of telling you that anything you say--"</p>

<p>"Mad," repeated Northover, with a weary air.</p>

<p>And at this moment, for the first time, there struck in among
them<br>
 the strange, sleepy voice of Basil Grant.</p>

<p>"Major Brown," he said, "may I ask you a question?"</p>

<p>The Major turned his head with an increased bewilderment.</p>

<p>"You?" he cried; "certainly, Mr Grant."</p>

<p>"Can you tell me," said the mystic, with sunken head and
lowering<br>
 brow, as he traced a pattern in the dust with his
sword-stick,<br>
 "can you tell me what was the name of the man who lived in
your<br>
 house before you?"</p>

<p>The unhappy Major was only faintly more disturbed by this last
and<br>
 futile irrelevancy, and he answered vaguely:</p>

<p>"Yes, I think so; a man named Gurney something--a name with
a<br>
 hyphen--Gurney-Brown; that was it."</p>

<p>"And when did the house change hands?" said Basil, looking
up<br>
 sharply. His strange eyes were burning brilliantly.</p>

<p>"I came in last month," said the Major.</p>

<p>And at the mere word the criminal Northover suddenly fell into
his<br>
 great office chair and shouted with a volleying laughter.</p>

<p>"Oh! it's too perfect--it's too exquisite," he gasped, beating
the<br>
 arms with his fists. He was laughing deafeningly; Basil Grant
was<br>
 laughing voicelessly; and the rest of us only felt that our
heads<br>
 were like weathercocks in a whirlwind.</p>

<p>"Confound it, Basil," said Rupert, stamping. "If you don't
want me<br>
 to go mad and blow your metaphysical brains out, tell me what
all<br>
 this means."</p>

<p>Northover rose.</p>

<p>"Permit me, sir, to explain," he said. "And, first of all,
permit<br>
 me to apologize to you, Major Brown, for a most abominable
and<br>
 unpardonable blunder, which has caused you menace and<br>
 inconvenience, in which, if you will allow me to say so, you
have<br>
 behaved with astonishing courage and dignity. Of course you
need<br>
 not trouble about the bill. We will stand the loss." And,
tearing<br>
 the paper across, he flung the halves into the waste-paper
basket<br>
 and bowed.</p>

<p>Poor Brown's face was still a picture of distraction. "But I
don't<br>
 even begin to understand," he cried. "What bill? what
blunder?<br>
 what loss?"</p>

<p>Mr P. G. Northover advanced in the centre of the room,<br>
 thoughtfully, and with a great deal of unconscious dignity.
On<br>
 closer consideration, there were apparent about him other
things<br>
 beside a screwed moustache, especially a lean, sallow face,<br>
 hawk-like, and not without a careworn intelligence. Then he
looked<br>
 up abruptly.</p>

<p>"Do you know where you are, Major?" he said.</p>

<p>"God knows I don't," said the warrior, with fervour.</p>

<p>"You are standing," replied Northover, "in the office of
the<br>
 Adventure and Romance Agency, Limited."</p>

<p>"And what's that?" blankly inquired Brown.</p>

<p>The man of business leaned over the back of the chair, and
fixed<br>
 his dark eyes on the other's face.</p>

<p>"Major," said he, "did you ever, as you walked along the
empty<br>
 street upon some idle afternoon, feel the utter hunger for<br>
 something to happen--something, in the splendid words of
Walt<br>
 Whitman: `Something pernicious and dread; something far
removed<br>
 from a puny and pious life; something unproved; something in
a<br>
 trance; something loosed from its anchorage, and driving
free.'<br>
 Did you ever feel that?"</p>

<p>"Certainly not," said the Major shortly.</p>

<p>"Then I must explain with more elaboration," said Mr
Northover,<br>
 with a sigh. "The Adventure and Romance Agency has been started
to<br>
 meet a great modern desire. On every side, in conversation and
in<br>
 literature, we hear of the desire for a larger theatre of
events<br>
 for something to waylay us and lead us splendidly astray. Now
the<br>
 man who feels this desire for a varied life pays a yearly or
a<br>
 quarterly sum to the Adventure and Romance Agency; in return,
the<br>
 Adventure and Romance Agency undertakes to surround him with<br>
 startling and weird events. As a man is leaving his front door,
an<br>
 excited sweep approaches him and assures him of a plot against
his<br>
 life; he gets into a cab, and is driven to an opium den; he<br>
 receives a mysterious telegram or a dramatic visit, and is<br>
 immediately in a vortex of incidents. A very picturesque and
moving<br>
 story is first written by one of the staff of distinguished<br>
 novelists who are at present hard at work in the adjoining
room.<br>
 Yours, Major Brown (designed by our Mr Grigsby), I consider<br>
 peculiarly forcible and pointed; it is almost a pity you did
not<br>
 see the end of it. I need scarcely explain further the
monstrous<br>
 mistake. Your predecessor in your present house, Mr
Gurney-Brown,<br>
 was a subscriber to our agency, and our foolish clerks,
ignoring<br>
 alike the dignity of the hyphen and the glory of military
rank,<br>
 positively imagined that Major Brown and Mr Gurney-Brown were
the<br>
 same person. Thus you were suddenly hurled into the middle
of<br>
 another man's story."</p>

<p>"How on earth does the thing work?" asked Rupert Grant, with
bright<br>
 and fascinated eyes.</p>

<p>"We believe that we are doing a noble work," said
Northover<br>
 warmly. "It has continually struck us that there is no element
in<br>
 modern life that is more lamentable than the fact that the
modern<br>
 man has to seek all artistic existence in a sedentary state. If
he<br>
 wishes to float into fairyland, he reads a book; if he wishes
to<br>
 dash into the thick of battle, he reads a book; if he wishes
to<br>
 soar into heaven, he reads a book; if he wishes to slide down
the<br>
 banisters, he reads a book. We give him these visions, but we
give<br>
 him exercise at the same time, the necessity of leaping from
wall<br>
 to wall, of fighting strange gentlemen, of running down long<br>
 streets from pursuers--all healthy and pleasant exercises. We
give<br>
 him a glimpse of that great morning world of Robin Hood or
the<br>
 Knights Errant, when one great game was played under the
splendid<br>
 sky. We give him back his childhood, that godlike time when we
can<br>
 act stories, be our own heroes, and at the same instant dance
and<br>
 dream."</p>

<p>Basil gazed at him curiously. The most singular
psychological<br>
 discovery had been reserved to the end, for as the little
business<br>
 man ceased speaking he had the blazing eyes of a fanatic.</p>

<p>Major Brown received the explanation with complete simplicity
and<br>
 good humour.</p>

<p>"Of course; awfully dense, sir," he said. "No doubt at all,
the<br>
 scheme excellent. But I don't think--" He paused a moment,
and<br>
 looked dreamily out of the window. "I don't think you will find
me<br>
 in it. Somehow, when one's seen--seen the thing itself, you<br>
 know--blood and men screaming, one feels about having a
little<br>
 house and a little hobby; in the Bible, you know, `There
remaineth<br>
 a rest'."</p>

<p>Northover bowed. Then after a pause he said:</p>

<p>"Gentlemen, may I offer you my card. If any of the rest of
you<br>
 desire, at any time, to communicate with me, despite Major
Brown's<br>
 view of the matter--"</p>

<p>"I should be obliged for your card, sir," said the Major, in
his<br>
 abrupt but courteous voice. "Pay for chair."</p>

<p>The agent of Romance and Adventure handed his card,
laughing.</p>

<p>It ran, "P. G. Northover, B.A., C.Q.T., Adventure and
Romance<br>
 Agency, 14 Tanner's Court, Fleet Street."</p>

<p>"What on earth is "C.QT."?" asked Rupert Grant, looking over
the<br>
 Major's shoulder.</p>

<p>"Don't you know?" returned Northover. "Haven't you ever heard
of<br>
 the Club of Queer Trades?"</p>

<p>"There seems to be a confounded lot of funny things we
haven't<br>
 heard of," said the little Major reflectively. "What's this
one?"</p>

<p>"The Club of Queer Trades is a society consisting exclusively
of<br>
 people who have invented some new and curious way of making
money.<br>
 I was one of the earliest members."</p>

<p>"You deserve to be," said Basil, taking up his great white
hat,<br>
 with a smile, and speaking for the last time that evening.</p>

<p>When they had passed out the Adventure and Romance agent wore
a<br>
 queer smile, as he trod down the fire and locked up his desk.
"A<br>
 fine chap, that Major; when one hasn't a touch of the poet
one<br>
 stands some chance of being a poem. But to think of such a<br>
 clockwork little creature of all people getting into the nets
of<br>
 one of Grigsby's tales," and he laughed out aloud in the
silence.</p>

<p>Just as the laugh echoed away, there came a sharp knock at
the<br>
 door. An owlish head, with dark moustaches, was thrust in,
with<br>
 deprecating and somewhat absurd inquiry.</p>

<p>"What! back again, Major?" cried Northover in surprise. "What
can<br>
 I do for you?"</p>

<p>The Major shuffled feverishly into the room.</p>

<p>"It's horribly absurd," he said. "Something must have got
started<br>
 in me that I never knew before. But upon my soul I feel the
most<br>
 desperate desire to know the end of it all."</p>

<p>"The end of it all?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said the Major. "`Jackals', and the title-deeds, and
`Death<br>
 to Major Brown'."</p>

<p>The agent's face grew grave, but his eyes were amused.</p>

<p>"I am terribly sorry, Major," said he, "but what you ask
is<br>
 impossible. I don't know any one I would sooner oblige than
you;<br>
 but the rules of the agency are strict. The Adventures are<br>
 confidential; you are an outsider; I am not allowed to let
you<br>
 know an inch more than I can help. I do hope you
understand--"</p>

<p>"There is no one," said Brown, "who understands discipline
better<br>
 than I do. Thank you very much. Good night."</p>

<p>And the little man withdrew for the last time.</p>

<p>He married Miss Jameson, the lady with the red hair and the
green<br>
 garments. She was an actress, employed (with many others) by
the<br>
 Romance Agency; and her marriage with the prim old veteran
caused<br>
 some stir in her languid and intellectualized set. She
always<br>
 replied very quietly that she had met scores of men who
acted<br>
 splendidly in the charades provided for them by Northover, but
that<br>
 she had only met one man who went down into a coal-cellar when
he<br>
 really thought it contained a murderer.</p>

<p>The Major and she are living as happily as birds, in an
absurd<br>
 villa, and the former has taken to smoking. Otherwise he is<br>
 unchanged--except, perhaps, there are moments when, alert and
full<br>
 of feminine unselfishness as the Major is by nature, he falls
into<br>
 a trance of abstraction. Then his wife recognizes with a
concealed<br>
 smile, by the blind look in his blue eyes, that he is
wondering<br>
 what were the title-deeds, and why he was not allowed to
mention<br>
 jackals. But, like so many old soldiers, Brown is religious,
and<br>
 believes that he will realize the rest of those purple
adventures<br>
 in a better world.</p>

<h2>Chapter 2</h2>

<h3>The Painful Fall of a Great Reputation</h3>

<p>Basil Grant and I were talking one day in what is perhaps the
most<br>
 perfect place for talking on earth--the top of a tolerably
deserted<br>
 tramcar. To talk on the top of a hill is superb, but to talk on
the<br>
 top of a flying hill is a fairy tale.</p>

<p>The vast blank space of North London was flying by; the very
pace<br>
 gave us a sense of its immensity and its meanness. It was, as
it<br>
 were, a base infinitude, a squalid eternity, and we felt the
real<br>
 horror of the poor parts of London, the horror that is so
totally<br>
 missed and misrepresented by the sensational novelists who
depict<br>
 it as being a matter of narrow streets, filthy houses,
criminals<br>
 and maniacs, and dens of vice. In a narrow street, in a den
of<br>
 vice, you do not expect civilization, you do not expect order.
But<br>
 the horror of this was the fact that there was civilization,
that<br>
 there was order, but that civilisation only showed its
morbidity,<br>
 and order only its monotony. No one would say, in going through
a<br>
 criminal slum, "I see no statues. I notice no cathedrals." But
here<br>
 there were public buildings; only they were mostly lunatic
asylums.<br>
 Here there were statues; only they were mostly statues of
railway<br>
 engineers and philanthropists--two dingy classes of men united
by<br>
 their common contempt for the people. Here there were
churches;<br>
 only they were the churches of dim and erratic sects,
Agapemonites<br>
 or Irvingites. Here, above all, there were broad roads and
vast<br>
 crossings and tramway lines and hospitals and all the real marks
of<br>
 civilization. But though one never knew, in one sense, what
one<br>
 would see next, there was one thing we knew we should not<br>
 see--anything really great, central, of the first class,
anything<br>
 that humanity had adored. And with revulsion indescribable
our<br>
 emotions returned, I think, to those really close and
crooked<br>
 entries, to those really mean streets, to those genuine slums
which<br>
 lie round the Thames and the City, in which nevertheless a
real<br>
 possibility remains that at any chance corner the great cross
of<br>
 the great cathedral of Wren may strike down the street like
a<br>
 thunderbolt.</p>

<p><br>
 "But you must always remember also," said Grant to me, in his
heavy<br>
 abstracted way, when I had urged this view, "that the very
vileness<br>
 of the life of these ordered plebeian places bears witness to
the<br>
 victory of the human soul. I agree with you. I agree that they
have<br>
 to live in something worse than barbarism. They have to live in
a<br>
 fourth-rate civilization. But yet I am practically certain that
the<br>
 majority of people here are good people. And being good is
an<br>
 adventure far more violent and daring than sailing round the
world.<br>
 Besides--"</p>

<p>"Go on," I said.</p>

<p>No answer came.</p>

<p>"Go on," I said, looking up.</p>

<p>The big blue eyes of Basil Grant were standing out of his head
and<br>
 he was paying no attention to me. He was staring over the side
of<br>
 the tram.</p>

<p>"What is the matter?" I asked, peering over also.</p>

<p>"It is very odd," said Grant at last, grimly, "that I should
have<br>
 been caught out like this at the very moment of my optimism. I
said<br>
 all these people were good, and there is the wickedest man
in<br>
 England."</p>

<p>"Where?" I asked, leaning over further, "where?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I was right enough," he went on, in that strange
continuous<br>
 and sleepy tone which always angered his hearers at acute
moments,<br>
 "I was right enough when I said all these people were good.
They<br>
 are heroes; they are saints. Now and then they may perhaps steal
a<br>
 spoon or two; they may beat a wife or two with the poker. But
they<br>
 are saints all the same; they are angels; they are robed in
white;<br>
 they are clad with wings and haloes--at any rate compared to
that<br>
 man."</p>

<p>"Which man?" I cried again, and then my eye caught the figure
at<br>
 which Basil's bull's eyes were glaring.</p>

<p>He was a slim, smooth person, passing very quickly among
the<br>
 quickly passing crowd, but though there was nothing about
him<br>
 sufficient to attract a startled notice, there was quite enough
to<br>
 demand a curious consideration when once that notice was
attracted.<br>
 He wore a black top-hat, but there was enough in it of those<br>
 strange curves whereby the decadent artist of the eighties tried
to<br>
 turn the top-hat into something as rhythmic as an Etruscan
vase.<br>
 His hair, which was largely grey, was curled with the instinct
of<br>
 one who appreciated the gradual beauty of grey and silver. The
rest<br>
 of his face was oval and, I thought, rather Oriental; he had
two<br>
 black tufts of moustache.</p>

<p>"What has he done?" I asked.</p>

<p>"I am not sure of the details," said Grant, "but his besetting
sin<br>
 is a desire to intrigue to the disadvantage of others. Probably
he<br>
 has adopted some imposture or other to effect his plan."</p>

<p>"What plan?" I asked. "If you know all about him, why don't
you<br>
 tell me why he is the wickedest man in England? What is his
name?"</p>

<p>Basil Grant stared at me for some moments.</p>

<p>"I think you've made a mistake in my meaning," he said. "I
don't<br>
 know his name. I never saw him before in my life."</p>

<p>"Never saw him before!" I cried, with a kind of anger; "then
what<br>
 in heaven's name do you mean by saying that he is the wickedest
man<br>
 in England?"</p>

<p>"I meant what I said," said Basil Grant calmly. "The moment I
saw<br>
 that man, I saw all these people stricken with a sudden and<br>
 splendid innocence. I saw that while all ordinary poor men in
the<br>
 streets were being themselves, he was not being himself. I saw
that<br>
 all the men in these slums, cadgers, pickpockets, hooligans,
are<br>
 all, in the deepest sense, trying to be good. And I saw that
that<br>
 man was trying to be evil."</p>

<p>"But if you never saw him before--" I began.</p>

<p>"In God's name, look at his face," cried out Basil in a voice
that<br>
 startled the driver. "Look at the eyebrows. They mean that
infernal<br>
 pride which made Satan so proud that he sneered even at heaven
when<br>
 he was one of the first angels in it. Look at his moustaches,
they<br>
 are so grown as to insult humanity. In the name of the
sacred<br>
 heavens look at his hair. In the name of God and the stars, look
at<br>
 his hat."</p>

<p>I stirred uncomfortably.</p>

<p>"But, after all," I said, "this is very fanciful--perfectly
absurd.<br>
 Look at the mere facts. You have never seen the man before,
you--"</p>

<p>"Oh, the mere facts," he cried out in a kind of despair. "The
mere<br>
 facts! Do you really admit--are you still so sunk in
superstitions,<br>
 so clinging to dim and prehistoric altars, that you believe
in<br>
 facts? Do you not trust an immediate impression?"</p>

<p>"Well, an immediate impression may be," I said, "a little
less<br>
 practical than facts."</p>

<p>"Bosh," he said. "On what else is the whole world run but
immediate<br>
 impressions? What is more practical? My friend, the philosophy
of<br>
 this world may be founded on facts, its business is run on<br>
 spiritual impressions and atmospheres. Why do you refuse or
accept<br>
 a clerk? Do you measure his skull? Do you read up his
physiological<br>
 state in a handbook? Do you go upon facts at all? Not a scrap.
You<br>
 accept a clerk who may save your business--you refuse a clerk
that<br>
 may rob your till, entirely upon those immediate mystical<br>
 impressions under the pressure of which I pronounce, with a
perfect<br>
 sense of certainty and sincerity, that that man walking in
that<br>
 street beside us is a humbug and a villain of some kind."</p>

<p>"You always put things well," I said, "but, of course, such
things<br>
 cannot immediately be put to the test."</p>

<p>Basil sprang up straight and swayed with the swaying car.</p>

<p>"Let us get off and follow him," he said. "I bet you five
pounds<br>
 it will turn out as I say."</p>

<p>And with a scuttle, a jump, and a run, we were off the
car.</p>

<p>The man with the curved silver hair and the curved Eastern
face<br>
 walked along for some time, his long splendid frock-coat
flying<br>
 behind him. Then he swung sharply out of the great glaring
road<br>
 and disappeared down an ill-lit alley. We swung silently
after<br>
 him.</p>

<p>"This is an odd turning for a man of that kind to take," I
said.</p>

<p>"A man of what kind?" asked my friend.</p>

<p>"Well," I said, "a man with that kind of expression and
those<br>
 boots. I thought it rather odd, to tell the truth, that he
should<br>
 be in this part of the world at all."</p>

<p>"Ah, yes," said Basil, and said no more.</p>

<p>We tramped on, looking steadily in front of us. The
elegant<br>
 figure, like the figure of a black swan, was silhouetted
suddenly<br>
 against the glare of intermittent gaslight and then
swallowed<br>
 again in night. The intervals between the lights were long, and
a<br>
 fog was thickening the whole city. Our pace, therefore, had
become<br>
 swift and mechanical between the lamp-posts; but Basil came to
a<br>
 standstill suddenly like a reined horse; I stopped also. We
had<br>
 almost run into the man. A great part of the solid darkness
in<br>
 front of us was the darkness of his body.</p>

<p>At first I thought he had turned to face us. But though we
were<br>
 hardly a yard off he did not realize that we were there. He
tapped<br>
 four times on a very low and dirty door in the dark, crabbed<br>
 street. A gleam of gas cut the darkness as it opened slowly.
We<br>
 listened intently, but the interview was short and simple
and<br>
 inexplicable as an interview could be. Our exquisite friend
handed<br>
 in what looked like a paper or a card and said:</p>

<p>"At once. Take a cab."</p>

<p>A heavy, deep voice from inside said:</p>

<p>"Right you are."</p>

<p>And with a click we were in the blackness again, and
striding<br>
 after the striding stranger through a labyrinth of London
lanes,<br>
 the lights just helping us. It was only five o'clock, but
winter<br>
 and the fog had made it like midnight.</p>

<p>"This is really an extraordinary walk for the
patent-leather<br>
 boots," I repeated.</p>

<p>"I don't know," said Basil humbly. "It leads to Berkeley
Square."</p>

<p>As I tramped on I strained my eyes through the dusky
atmosphere<br>
 and tried to make out the direction described. For some ten<br>
 minutes I wondered and doubted; at the end of that I saw
that<br>
 my friend was right. We were coming to the great dreary
spaces<br>
 of fashionable London--more dreary, one must admit, even
than<br>
 the dreary plebeian spaces.</p>

<p>"This is very extraordinary!" said Basil Grant, as we turned
into<br>
 Berkeley Square.</p>

<p>"What is extraordinary?" I asked. "I thought you said it was
quite<br>
 natural."</p>

<p>"I do not wonder," answered Basil, "at his walking through
nasty<br>
 streets; I do not wonder at his going to Berkeley Square. But I
do<br>
 wonder at his going to the house of a very good man."</p>

<p>"What very good man?" I asked with exasperation.</p>

<p>"The operation of time is a singular one," he said with
his<br>
 imperturbable irrelevancy. "It is not a true statement of the
case<br>
 to say that I have forgotten my career when I was a judge and
a<br>
 public man. I remember it all vividly, but it is like
remembering<br>
 some novel. But fifteen years ago I knew this square as well
as<br>
 Lord Rosebery does, and a confounded long sight better than
that<br>
 man who is going up the steps of old Beaumont's house."</p>

<p>"Who is old Beaumont?" I asked irritably.</p>

<p>"A perfectly good fellow. Lord Beaumont of Foxwood--don't you
know<br>
 his name? He is a man of transparent sincerity, a nobleman
who<br>
 does more work than a navvy, a socialist, an anarchist, I
don't<br>
 know what; anyhow, he's a philosopher and philanthropist. I
admit<br>
 he has the slight disadvantage of being, beyond all question,
off<br>
 his head. He has that real disadvantage which has arisen out
of<br>
 the modern worship of progress and novelty; and he thinks
anything<br>
 odd and new must be an advance. If you went to him and proposed
to<br>
 eat your grandmother, he would agree with you, so long as you
put<br>
 it on hygienic and public grounds, as a cheap alternative to<br>
 cremation. So long as you progress fast enough it seems a
matter<br>
 of indifference to him whether you are progressing to the stars
or<br>
 the devil. So his house is filled with an endless succession
of<br>
 literary and political fashions; men who wear long hair because
it<br>
 is romantic; men who wear short hair because it is medical;
men<br>
 who walk on their feet only to exercise their hands; and men
who<br>
 walk on their hands for fear of tiring their feet. But though
the<br>
 inhabitants of his salons are generally fools, like himself,
they<br>
 are almost always, like himself, good men. I am really
surprised<br>
 to see a criminal enter there."</p>

<p>"My good fellow," I said firmly, striking my foot on the
pavement,<br>
 "the truth of this affair is very simple. To use your own
eloquent<br>
 language, you have the `slight disadvantage' of being off
your<br>
 head. You see a total stranger in a public street; you choose
to<br>
 start certain theories about his eyebrows. You then treat him as
a<br>
 burglar because he enters an honest man's door. The thing is
too<br>
 monstrous. Admit that it is, Basil, and come home with me.
Though<br>
 these people are still having tea, yet with the distance we have
to<br>
 go, we shall be late for dinner."</p>

<p>Basil's eyes were shining in the twilight like lamps.</p>

<p>"I thought," he said, "that I had outlived vanity."</p>

<p>"What do you want now?" I cried.</p>

<p>"I want," he cried out, "what a girl wants when she wears her
new<br>
 frock; I want what a boy wants when he goes in for a clanging
match<br>
 with a monitor--I want to show somebody what a fine fellow I am.
I<br>
 am as right about that man as I am about your having a hat on
your<br>
 head. You say it cannot be tested. I say it can. I will take you
to<br>
 see my old friend Beaumont. He is a delightful man to know."</p>

<p>"Do you really mean--?" I began.</p>

<p>"I will apologize," he said calmly, "for our not being
dressed<br>
 for a call," and walking across the vast misty square, he
walked<br>
 up the dark stone steps and rang at the bell.</p>

<p>A severe servant in black and white opened the door to us:
on<br>
 receiving my friend's name his manner passed in a flash from<br>
 astonishment to respect. We were ushered into the house very<br>
 quickly, but not so quickly but that our host, a
white-haired<br>
 man with a fiery face, came out quickly to meet us.</p>

<p>"My dear fellow," he cried, shaking Basil's hand again and
again,<br>
 "I have not seen you for years. Have you been--er--" he
said,<br>
 rather wildly, "have you been in the country?"</p>

<p>"Not for all that time," answered Basil, smiling. "I have
long<br>
 given up my official position, my dear Philip, and have been<br>
 living in a deliberate retirement. I hope I do not come at
an<br>
 inopportune moment."</p>

<p>"An inopportune moment," cried the ardent gentleman. "You come
at<br>
 the most opportune moment I could imagine. Do you know who
is<br>
 here?"</p>

<p>"I do not," answered Grant, with gravity. Even as he spoke a
roar<br>
 of laughter came from the inner room.</p>

<p>"Basil," said Lord Beaumont solemnly, "I have Wimpole
here."</p>

<p>"And who is Wimpole?"</p>

<p>"Basil," cried the other, "you must have been in the
country.<br>
 You must have been in the antipodes. You must have been in
the<br>
 moon. Who is Wimpole? Who was Shakespeare?"</p>

<p>"As to who Shakespeare was," answered my friend placidly, "my
views<br>
 go no further than thinking that he was not Bacon. More probably
he<br>
 was Mary Queen of Scots. But as to who Wimpole is--" and his
speech<br>
 also was cloven with a roar of laughter from within.</p>

<p>"Wimpole!" cried Lord Beaumont, in a sort of ecstasy.
"Haven't<br>
 you heard of the great modern wit? My dear fellow, he has
turned<br>
 conversation, I do not say into an art--for that, perhaps,
it<br>
 always was but into a great art, like the statuary of
Michael<br>
 Angelo--an art of masterpieces. His repartees, my good
friend,<br>
 startle one like a man shot dead. They are final; they
are--"</p>

<p>Again there came the hilarious roar from the room, and almost
with<br>
 the very noise of it, a big, panting apoplectic old gentleman
came<br>
 out of the inner house into the hall where we were standing.</p>

<p>"Now, my dear chap," began Lord Beaumont hastily.</p>

<p>"I tell you, Beaumont, I won't stand it," exploded the large
old<br>
 gentleman. "I won't be made game of by a twopenny literary<br>
 adventurer like that. I won't be made a guy. I won't--"</p>

<p>"Come, come," said Beaumont feverishly. "Let me introduce
you.<br>
 This is Mr Justice Grant--that is, Mr Grant. Basil, I am sure
you<br>
 have heard of Sir Walter Cholmondeliegh."</p>

<p>"Who has not?" asked Grant, and bowed to the worthy old
baronet,<br>
 eyeing him with some curiosity. He was hot and heavy in his<br>
 momentary anger, but even that could not conceal the noble
though<br>
 opulent outline of his face and body, the florid white hair,
the<br>
 Roman nose, the body stalwart though corpulent, the chin<br>
 aristocratic though double. He was a magnificent courtly
gentleman;<br>
 so much of a gentleman that he could show an unquestionable<br>
 weakness of anger without altogether losing dignity; so much of
a<br>
 gentleman that even his faux pas were well-bred.</p>

<p>"I am distressed beyond expression, Beaumont," he said
gruffly,<br>
 "to fail in respect to these gentlemen, and even more
especially<br>
 to fail in it in your house. But it is not you or they that
are<br>
 in any way concerned, but that flashy half-caste
jackanapes--"</p>

<p>At this moment a young man with a twist of red moustache and
a<br>
 sombre air came out of the inner room. He also did not seem to
be<br>
 greatly enjoying the intellectual banquet within.</p>

<p>"I think you remember my friend and secretary, Mr Drummond,"
said<br>
 Lord Beaumont, turning to Grant, "even if you only remember him
as<br>
 a schoolboy."</p>

<p>"Perfectly," said the other. Mr Drummond shook hands
pleasantly<br>
 and respectfully, but the cloud was still on his brow. Turning
to<br>
 Sir Walter Cholmondeliegh, he said:</p>

<p>"I was sent by Lady Beaumont to express her hope that you were
not<br>
 going yet, Sir Walter. She says she has scarcely seen anything
of<br>
 you."</p>

<p>The old gentleman, still red in the face, had a temporary
internal<br>
 struggle; then his good manners triumphed, and with a gesture
of<br>
 obeisance and a vague utterance of, "If Lady Beaumont . . . a
lady,<br>
 of course," he followed the young man back into the salon. He
had<br>
 scarcely been deposited there half a minute before another peal
of<br>
 laughter told that he had (in all probability) been scored
off<br>
 again.</p>

<p>"Of course, I can excuse dear old Cholmondeliegh," said
Beaumont,<br>
 as he helped us off with our coats. "He has not the modern
mind."</p>

<p>"What is the modern mind?" asked Grant.</p>

<p>"Oh, it's enlightened, you know, and progressive--and faces
the<br>
 facts of life seriously." At this moment another roar of
laughter<br>
 came from within.</p>

<p>"I only ask," said Basil, "because of the last two friends of
yours<br>
 who had the modern mind; one thought it wrong to eat fishes and
the<br>
 other thought it right to eat men. I beg your pardon--this way,
if<br>
 I remember right."</p>

<p>"Do you know," said Lord Beaumont, with a sort of feverish<br>
 entertainment, as he trotted after us towards the interior, "I
can<br>
 never quite make out which side you are on. Sometimes you seem
so<br>
 liberal and sometimes so reactionary. Are you a modern,
Basil?"</p>

<p>"No," said Basil, loudly and cheerfully, as he entered the
crowded<br>
 drawing-room.</p>

<p>This caused a slight diversion, and some eyes were turned
away<br>
 from our slim friend with the Oriental face for the first
time<br>
 that afternoon. Two people, however, still looked at him. One
was<br>
 the daughter of the house, Muriel Beaumont, who gazed at him
with<br>
 great violet eyes and with the intense and awful thirst of
the<br>
 female upper class for verbal amusement and stimulus. The
other<br>
 was Sir Walter Cholmondeliegh, who looked at him with a still
and<br>
 sullen but unmistakable desire to throw him out of the
window.</p>

<p>He sat there, coiled rather than seated on the easy chair;<br>
 everything from the curves of his smooth limbs to the coils of
his<br>
 silvered hair suggesting the circles of a serpent more than
the<br>
 straight limbs of a man--the unmistakable, splendid
serpentine<br>
 gentleman we had seen walking in North London, his eyes
shining<br>
 with repeated victory.</p>

<p>"What I can't understand, Mr Wimpole," said Muriel
Beaumont<br>
 eagerly, "is how you contrive to treat all this so easily. You
say<br>
 things quite philosophical and yet so wildly funny. If I
thought<br>
 of such things, I'm sure I should laugh outright when the
thought<br>
 first came."</p>

<p>"I agree with Miss Beaumont," said Sir Walter, suddenly
exploding<br>
 with indignation. "If I had thought of anything so futile, I
should<br>
 find it difficult to keep my countenance."</p>

<p>"Difficult to keep your countenance," cried Mr Wimpole, with
an air<br>
 of alarm; "oh, do keep your countenance! Keep it in the
British<br>
 Museum."</p>

<p>Every one laughed uproariously, as they always do at an
already<br>
 admitted readiness, and Sir Walter, turning suddenly purple,<br>
 shouted out:</p>

<p>"Do you know who you are talking to, with your confounded<br>
 tomfooleries?"</p>

<p>"I never talk tomfooleries," said the other, "without first
knowing<br>
 my audience."</p>

<p>Grant walked across the room and tapped the red-moustached<br>
 secretary on the shoulder. That gentleman was leaning against
the<br>
 wall regarding the whole scene with a great deal of gloom; but,
I<br>
 fancied, with very particular gloom when his eyes fell on the
young<br>
 lady of the house rapturously listening to Wimpole.</p>

<p>"May I have a word with you outside, Drummond?" asked Grant.
"It is<br>
 about business. Lady Beaumont will excuse us."</p>

<p>I followed my friend, at his own request, greatly wondering,
to<br>
 this strange external interview. We passed abruptly into a kind
of<br>
 side room out of the hall.</p>

<p>"Drummond," said Basil sharply, "there are a great many
good<br>
 people, and a great many sane people here this afternoon.<br>
 Unfortunately, by a kind of coincidence, all the good people
are<br>
 mad, and all the sane people are wicked. You are the only person
I<br>
 know of here who is honest and has also some common sense. What
do<br>
 you make of Wimpole?"</p>

<p>Mr Secretary Drummond had a pale face and red hair; but at
this his<br>
 face became suddenly as red as his moustache.</p>

<p>"I am not a fair judge of him," he said.</p>

<p>"Why not?" asked Grant.</p>

<p>"Because I hate him like hell," said the other, after a long
pause<br>
 and violently.</p>

<p>Neither Grant nor I needed to ask the reason; his glances
towards<br>
 Miss Beaumont and the stranger were sufficiently
illuminating.<br>
 Grant said quietly:</p>

<p>"But before--before you came to hate him, what did you really
think<br>
 of him?"</p>

<p>"I am in a terrible difficulty," said the young man, and his
voice<br>
 told us, like a clear bell, that he was an honest man. "If I
spoke<br>
 about him as I feel about him now, I could not trust myself. And
I<br>
 should like to be able to say that when I first saw him I
thought<br>
 he was charming. But again, the fact is I didn't. I hate him,
that<br>
 is my private affair. But I also disapprove of him--really I
do<br>
 believe I disapprove of him quite apart from my private
feelings.<br>
 When first he came, I admit he was much quieter, but I did
not<br>
 like, so to speak, the moral swell of him. Then that jolly old
Sir<br>
 Walter Cholmondeliegh got introduced to us, and this fellow,
with<br>
 his cheap-jack wit, began to score off the old man in the way
he<br>
 does now. Then I felt that he must be a bad lot; it must be bad
to<br>
 fight the old and the kindly. And he fights the poor old
chap<br>
 savagely, unceasingly, as if he hated old age and kindliness.
Take,<br>
 if you want it, the evidence of a prejudiced witness. I admit
that<br>
 I hate the man because a certain person admires him. But I
believe<br>
 that apart from that I should hate the man because old Sir
Walter<br>
 hates him."</p>

<p>This speech affected me with a genuine sense of esteem and
pity for<br>
 the young man; that is, of pity for him because of his
obviously<br>
 hopeless worship of Miss Beaumont, and of esteem for him because
of<br>
 the direct realistic account of the history of Wimpole which he
had<br>
 given. Still, I was sorry that he seemed so steadily set
against<br>
 the man, and could not help referring it to an instinct of
his<br>
 personal relations, however nobly disguised from himself.</p>

<p>In the middle of these meditations, Grant whispered in my ear
what<br>
 was perhaps the most startling of all interruptions.</p>

<p>"In the name of God, let's get away."</p>

<p>I have never known exactly in how odd a way this odd old
man<br>
 affected me. I only know that for some reason or other he so<br>
 affected me that I was, within a few minutes, in the street<br>
 outside.</p>

<p>"This," he said, "is a beastly but amusing affair."</p>

<p>"What is?" I asked, baldly enough.</p>

<p>"This affair. Listen to me, my old friend. Lord and Lady
Beaumont<br>
 have just invited you and me to a grand dinner-party this
very<br>
 night, at which Mr Wimpole will be in all his glory. Well,
there<br>
 is nothing very extraordinary about that. The extraordinary
thing<br>
 is that we are not going."</p>

<p>"Well, really," I said, "it is already six o'clock and I doubt
if<br>
 we could get home and dress. I see nothing extraordinary in
the<br>
 fact that we are not going."</p>

<p>"Don't you?" said Grant. "I'll bet you'll see something<br>
 extraordinary in what we're doing instead."</p>

<p>I looked at him blankly.</p>

<p>"Doing instead?" I asked. "What are we doing instead?"</p>

<p>"Why," said he, "we are waiting for one or two hours outside
this<br>
 house on a winter evening. You must forgive me; it is all my<br>
 vanity. It is only to show you that I am right. Can you, with
the<br>
 assistance of this cigar, wait until both Sir Walter
Cholmondeliegh<br>
 and the mystic Wimpole have left this house?"</p>

<p>"Certainly," I said. "But I do not know which is likely to
leave<br>
 first. Have you any notion?"</p>

<p>"No," he said. "Sir Walter may leave first in a glow of rage.
Or<br>
 again, Mr Wimpole may leave first, feeling that his last epigram
is<br>
 a thing to be flung behind him like a firework. And Sir Walter
may<br>
 remain some time to analyse Mr Wimpole's character. But they
will<br>
 both have to leave within reasonable time, for they will both
have<br>
 to get dressed and come back to dinner here tonight."</p>

<p>As he spoke the shrill double whistle from the porch of the
great<br>
 house drew a dark cab to the dark portal. And then a thing
happened<br>
 that we really had not expected. Mr Wimpole and Sir Walter<br>
 Cholmondeliegh came out at the same moment.</p>

<p>They paused for a second or two opposite each other in a
natural<br>
 doubt; then a certain geniality, fundamental perhaps in both
of<br>
 them, made Sir Walter smile and say: "The night is foggy.
Pray<br>
 take my cab."</p>

<p>Before I could count twenty the cab had gone rattling up the
street<br>
 with both of them. And before I could count twenty-three Grant
had<br>
 hissed in my ear:</p>

<p>"Run after the cab; run as if you were running from a mad
dog--<br>
 run."</p>

<p>We pelted on steadily, keeping the cab in sight, through dark
mazy<br>
 streets. God only, I thought, knows why we are running at all,
but<br>
 we are running hard. Fortunately we did not run far. The cab
pulled<br>
 up at the fork of two streets and Sir Walter paid the cabman,
who<br>
 drove away rejoicing, having just come in contact with the
more<br>
 generous among the rich. Then the two men talked together as men
do<br>
 talk together after giving and receiving great insults, the
talk<br>
 which leads either to forgiveness or a duel--at least so it
seemed<br>
 as we watched it from ten yards off. Then the two men shook
hands<br>
 heartily, and one went down one fork of the road and one
down<br>
 another.</p>

<p>Basil, with one of his rare gestures, flung his arms
forward.</p>

<p>"Run after that scoundrel," he cried; "let us catch him
now."</p>

<p>We dashed across the open space and reached the juncture of
two paths.</p>

<p>"Stop!" I shouted wildly to Grant. "That's the wrong
turning."</p>

<p>He ran on.</p>

<p>"Idiot!" I howled. "Sir Walter's gone down there. Wimpole
has<br>
 slipped us. He's half a mile down the other road. You're wrong .
. .<br>
 Are you deaf? You're wrong!"</p>

<p>"I don't think I am," he panted, and ran on.</p>

<p>"But I saw him!" I cried. "Look in front of you. Is that
Wimpole?<br>
 It's the old man . . . What are you doing? What are we to
do?"</p>

<p>"Keep running," said Grant.</p>

<p>Running soon brought us up to the broad back of the pompous
old<br>
 baronet, whose white whiskers shone silver in the fitful
lamplight.<br>
 My brain was utterly bewildered. I grasped nothing.</p>

<p>"Charlie," said Basil hoarsely, "can you believe in my common
sense<br>
 for four minutes?"</p>

<p>"Of course," I said, panting.</p>

<p>"Then help me to catch that man in front and hold him down. Do
it<br>
 at once when I say `Now'. Now!"</p>

<p>We sprang on Sir Walter Cholmondeliegh, and rolled that portly
old<br>
 gentleman on his back. He fought with a commendable valour, but
we<br>
 got him tight. I had not the remotest notion why. He had a
splendid<br>
 and full-blooded vigour; when he could not box he kicked, and
we<br>
 bound him; when he could not kick he shouted, and we gagged
him.<br>
 Then, by Basil's arrangement, we dragged him into a small court
by<br>
 the street side and waited. As I say, I had no notion why.</p>

<p>"I am sorry to incommode you," said Basil calmly out of
the<br>
 darkness; "but I have made an appointment here."</p>

<p>"An appointment!" I said blankly.</p>

<p>"Yes," he said, glancing calmly at the apoplectic old
aristocrat gagged on the ground, whose eyes were starting
impotently from his head. "I have made an appointment here with a
thoroughly nice young fellow. An old friend. Jasper Drummond his
name is--you may have met him this afternoon at the Beaumonts. He
can scarcely come though till the Beaumonts' dinner is over."</p>

<p>For I do not know how many hours we stood there calmly in the
darkness. By the time those hours were over I had thoroughly made
up my mind that the same thing had happened which had happened
long ago on the bench of a British Court of Justice. Basil Grant
had gone mad. I could imagine no other explanation of the facts,
with the portly, purple-faced old country gentleman flung there
strangled on the floor like a bundle of wood.</p>

<p>After about four hours a lean figure in evening dress rushed
into<br>
 the court. A glimpse of gaslight showed the red moustache and
white<br>
 face of Jasper Drummond.</p>

<p>"Mr Grant," he said blankly, "the thing is incredible. You
were<br>
 right; but what did you mean? All through this dinner-party,
where<br>
 dukes and duchesses and editors of Quarterlies had come
especially<br>
 to hear him, that extraordinary Wimpole kept perfectly silent.
He<br>
 didn't say a funny thing. He didn't say anything at all. What
does<br>
 it mean?"</p>

<p>Grant pointed to the portly old gentleman on the ground.</p>

<p>"That is what it means," he said.</p>

<p>Drummond, on observing a fat gentleman lying so calmly about
the<br>
 place, jumped back, as from a mouse.</p>

<p>"What?" he said weakly, ". . . what?"</p>

<p>Basil bent suddenly down and tore a paper out of Sir
Walter's<br>
 breastpocket, a paper which the baronet, even in his
hampered<br>
 state, seemed to make some effort to retain.</p>

<p>It was a large loose piece of white wrapping paper, which Mr
Jasper<br>
 Drummond read with a vacant eye and undisguised astonishment.
As<br>
 far as he could make out, it consisted of a series of questions
and<br>
 answers, or at least of remarks and replies, arranged in the
manner<br>
 of a catechism. The greater part of the document had been torn
and<br>
 obliterated in the struggle, but the termination remained. It
ran<br>
 as follows:</p>

<p>C. Says . . . Keep countenance.</p>

<p>W. Keep . . . British Museum.</p>

<p>C. Know whom talk . . . absurdities.</p>

<p>W. Never talk absurdities without</p>

<p>"What is it?" cried Drummond, flinging the paper down in a
sort of<br>
 final fury.</p>

<p>"What is it?" replied Grant, his voice rising into a kind
of<br>
 splendid chant. "What is it? It is a great new profession. A
great<br>
 new trade. A trifle immoral, I admit, but still great, like<br>
 piracy."</p>

<p>"A new profession!" said the young man with the red
moustache<br>
 vaguely; "a new trade!"</p>

<p>"A new trade," repeated Grant, with a strange exultation, "a
new<br>
 profession! What a pity it is immoral."</p>

<p>"But what the deuce is it?" cried Drummond and I in a breath
of<br>
 blasphemy.</p>

<p>"It is," said Grant calmly, "the great new trade of the
Organizer<br>
 of Repartee. This fat old gentleman lying on the ground
strikes<br>
 you, as I have no doubt, as very stupid and very rich. Let me
clear<br>
 his character. He is, like ourselves, very clever and very poor.
He<br>
 is also not really at all fat; all that is stuffing. He is
not<br>
 particularly old, and his name is not Cholmondeliegh. He is
a<br>
 swindler, and a swindler of a perfectly delightful and novel
kind.<br>
 He hires himself out at dinner-parties to lead up to other
people's<br>
 repartees. According to a preconcerted scheme (which you may
find<br>
 on that piece of paper), he says the stupid things he has
arranged<br>
 for himself, and his client says the clever things arranged
for<br>
 him. In short, he allows himself to be scored off for a guinea
a<br>
 night."</p>

<p>"And this fellow Wimpole--" began Drummond with
indignation.</p>

<p>"This fellow Wimpole," said Basil Grant, smiling, "will not be
an<br>
 intellectual rival in the future. He had some fine things,
elegance<br>
 and silvered hair, and so on. But the intellect is with our
friend<br>
 on the floor."</p>

<p><br>
 "That fellow," cried Drummond furiously, "that fellow ought to
be<br>
 in gaol."</p>

<p>"Not at all," said Basil indulgently; "he ought to be in the
Club<br>
 of Queer Trades."</p>

<h2>Chapter 3</h2>

<h3>The Awful Reason of the Vicar's Visit</h3>

<p>The revolt of Matter against Man (which I believe to exist)
has now<br>
 been reduced to a singular condition. It is the small things
rather<br>
 than the large things which make war against us and, I may
add,<br>
 beat us. The bones of the last mammoth have long ago decayed,
a<br>
 mighty wreck; the tempests no longer devour our navies, nor
the<br>
 mountains with hearts of fire heap hell over our cities. But we
are<br>
 engaged in a bitter and eternal war with small things; chiefly
with<br>
 microbes and with collar studs. The stud with which I was
engaged<br>
 (on fierce and equal terms) as I made the above reflections,
was<br>
 one which I was trying to introduce into my shirt collar when
a<br>
 loud knock came at the door.</p>

<p><br>
 My first thought was as to whether Basil Grant had called to
fetch<br>
 me. He and I were to turn up at the same dinner-party (for which
I<br>
 was in the act of dressing), and it might be that he had taken
it<br>
 into his head to come my way, though we had arranged to go<br>
 separately. It was a small and confidential affair at the table
of<br>
 a good but unconventional political lady, an old friend of his.
She<br>
 had asked us both to meet a third guest, a Captain Fraser, who
had<br>
 made something of a name and was an authority on chimpanzees.
As<br>
 Basil was an old friend of the hostess and I had never seen her,
I<br>
 felt that it was quite possible that he (with his usual
social<br>
 sagacity) might have decided to take me along in order to break
the<br>
 ice. The theory, like all my theories, was complete; but as a
fact<br>
 it was not Basil.</p>

<p>I was handed a visiting card inscribed: "Rev. Ellis Shorter",
and<br>
 underneath was written in pencil, but in a hand in which even
hurry<br>
 could not conceal a depressing and gentlemanly excellence,
"Asking<br>
 the favour of a few moments' conversation on a most urgent<br>
 matter."!</p>

<p>I had already subdued the stud, thereby proclaiming that the
image<br>
 of God has supremacy over all matters (a valuable truth),
and<br>
 throwing on my dress-coat and waistcoat, hurried into the<br>
 drawing-room. He rose at my entrance, flapping like a seal; I
can<br>
 use no other description. He flapped a plaid shawl over his
right<br>
 arm; he flapped a pair of pathetic black gloves; he flapped
his<br>
 clothes; I may say, without exaggeration, that he flapped
his<br>
 eyelids, as he rose. He was a bald-browed, white-haired,<br>
 white-whiskered old clergyman, of a flappy and floppy type.
He<br>
 said:</p>

<p>"I am so sorry. I am so very sorry. I am so extremely sorry. I
come<br>
 --I can only say--I can only say in my defence, that I
come--upon<br>
 an important matter. Pray forgive me."</p>

<p>I told him I forgave perfectly and waited.</p>

<p>"What I have to say," he said brokenly, "is so dreadful--it is
so<br>
 dreadful--I have lived a quiet life."</p>

<p>I was burning to get away, for it was already doubtful if I
should<br>
 be in time for dinner. But there was something about the old
man's<br>
 honest air of bitterness that seemed to open to me the<br>
 possibilities of life larger and more tragic than my own.</p>

<p>I said gently: "Pray go on."</p>

<p>Nevertheless the old gentleman, being a gentleman as well as
old,<br>
 noticed my secret impatience and seemed still more unmanned.</p>

<p>"I'm so sorry," he said meekly; "I wouldn't have come--but
for--<br>
 your friend Major Brown recommended me to come here."</p>

<p>"Major Brown!" I said, with some interest.</p>

<p>"Yes," said the Reverend Mr Shorter, feverishly flapping his
plaid<br>
 shawl about. "He told me you helped him in a great
difficulty--and<br>
 my difficulty! Oh, my dear sir, it's a matter of life and
death."</p>

<p>I rose abruptly, in an acute perplexity. "Will it take long,
Mr<br>
 Shorter?" I asked. "I have to go out to dinner almost at
once."</p>

<p>He rose also, trembling from head to foot, and yet somehow,
with<br>
 all his moral palsy, he rose to the dignity of his age and
his<br>
 office.</p>

<p>"I have no right, Mr Swinburne--I have no right at all," he
said.<br>
 "If you have to go out to dinner, you have of course--a
perfect<br>
 right--of course a perfect right. But when you come back--a
man<br>
 will be dead."</p>

<p>And he sat down, quaking like a jelly.</p>

<p>The triviality of the dinner had been in those two minutes
dwarfed<br>
 and drowned in my mind. I did not want to go and see a
political<br>
 widow, and a captain who collected apes; I wanted to hear what
had<br>
 brought this dear, doddering old vicar into relation with
immediate<br>
 perils.</p>

<p>"Will you have a cigar?" I said.</p>

<p>"No, thank you," he said, with indescribable embarrassment, as
if<br>
 not smoking cigars was a social disgrace.</p>

<p>"A glass of wine?" I said.</p>

<p>"No, thank you, no, thank you; not just now," he repeated
with<br>
 that hysterical eagerness with which people who do not drink
at<br>
 all often try to convey that on any other night of the week
they<br>
 would sit up all night drinking rum-punch. "Not just now,
thank<br>
 you."</p>

<p>"Nothing else I can get for you?" I said, feeling genuinely
sorry<br>
 for the well-mannered old donkey. "A cup of tea?"</p>

<p>I saw a struggle in his eye and I conquered. When the cup of
tea<br>
 came he drank it like a dipsomaniac gulping brandy. Then he
fell<br>
 back and said:</p>

<p>"I have had such a time, Mr Swinburne. I am not used to
these<br>
 excitements. As Vicar of Chuntsey, in Essex'--he threw this
in<br>
 with an indescribable airiness of vanity--'I have never
known<br>
 such things happen."</p>

<p>"What things happen?" I asked.</p>

<p>He straightened himself with sudden dignity.</p>

<p>"As Vicar of Chuntsey, in Essex," he said, "I have never
been<br>
 forcibly dressed up as an old woman and made to take part in
a<br>
 crime in the character of an old woman. Never once. My
experience<br>
 may be small. It may be insufficient. But it has never
occurred<br>
 to me before."</p>

<p>"I have never heard of it," I said, "as among the duties of
a<br>
 clergyman. But I am not well up in church matters. Excuse me
if<br>
 perhaps I failed to follow you correctly. Dressed up--as
what?"</p>

<p>"As an old woman," said the vicar solemnly, "as an old
woman."</p>

<p>I thought in my heart that it required no great transformation
to<br>
 make an old woman of him, but the thing was evidently more
tragic<br>
 than comic, and I said respectfully:</p>

<p>"May I ask how it occurred?"</p>

<p>"I will begin at the beginning," said Mr Shorter, "and I will
tell<br>
 my story with the utmost possible precision. At seventeen
minutes<br>
 past eleven this morning I left the vicarage to keep certain<br>
 appointments and pay certain visits in the village. My first
visit<br>
 was to Mr Jervis, the treasurer of our League of Christian<br>
 Amusements, with whom I concluded some business touching the
claim<br>
 made by Parkes the gardener in the matter of the rolling of
our<br>
 tennis lawn. I then visited Mrs Arnett, a very earnest<br>
 churchwoman, but permanently bedridden. She is the author of<br>
 several small works of devotion, and of a book of verse,
entitled<br>
 (unless my memory misleads me) Eglantine."</p>

<p>He uttered all this not only with deliberation, but with
something<br>
 that can only be called, by a contradictory phrase, eager<br>
 deliberation. He had, I think, a vague memory in his head of
the<br>
 detectives in the detective stories, who always sternly
require<br>
 that nothing should be kept back.</p>

<p>"I then proceeded," he went on, with the same maddening<br>
 conscientiousness of manner, "to Mr Carr (not Mr James Carr,
of<br>
 course; Mr Robert Carr) who is temporarily assisting our
organist,<br>
 and having consulted with him (on the subject of a choir boy
who<br>
 is accused, I cannot as yet say whether justly or not, of
cutting<br>
 holes in the organ pipes), I finally dropped in upon a
Dorcas<br>
 meeting at the house of Miss Brett. The Dorcas meetings are<br>
 usually held at the vicarage, but my wife being unwell, Miss<br>
 Brett, a newcomer in our village, but very active in church
work,<br>
 had very kindly consented to hold them. The Dorcas society
is<br>
 entirely under my wife's management as a rule, and except for
Miss<br>
 Brett, who, as I say, is very active, I scarcely know any
members<br>
 of it. I had, however, promised to drop in on them, and I did
so.</p>

<p>"When I arrived there were only four other maiden ladies with
Miss<br>
 Brett, but they were sewing very busily. It is very difficult,
of<br>
 course, for any person, however strongly impressed with the<br>
 necessity in these matters of full and exact exposition of
the<br>
 facts, to remember and repeat the actual details of a<br>
 conversation, particularly a conversation which (though
inspired<br>
 with a most worthy and admirable zeal for good work) was one
which<br>
 did not greatly impress the hearer's mind at the time and was
in<br>
 fact--er--mostly about socks. I can, however, remember
distinctly<br>
 that one of the spinster ladies (she was a thin person with
a<br>
 woollen shawl, who appeared to feel the cold, and I am almost
sure<br>
 she was introduced to me as Miss James) remarked that the
weather<br>
 was very changeable. Miss Brett then offered me a cup of
tea,<br>
 which I accepted, I cannot recall in what words. Miss Brett is
a<br>
 short and stout lady with white hair. The only other figure in
the<br>
 group that caught my attention was a Miss Mowbray, a small
and<br>
 neat lady of aristocratic manners, silver hair, and a high
voice<br>
 and colour. She was the most emphatic member of the party; and
her<br>
 views on the subject of pinafores, though expressed with a
natural<br>
 deference to myself, were in themselves strong and advanced.<br>
 Beside her (although all five ladies were dressed simply in
black)<br>
 it could not be denied that the others looked in some way what
you<br>
 men of the world would call dowdy.</p>

<p>"After about ten minutes' conversation I rose to go, and as I
did<br>
 so I heard something which--I cannot describe it--something
which<br>
 seemed to--but I really cannot describe it."</p>

<p>"What did you hear?" I asked, with some impatience.</p>

<p>"I heard," said the vicar solemnly, "I heard Miss Mowbray
(the<br>
 lady with the silver hair) say to Miss James (the lady with
the<br>
 woollen shawl), the following extraordinary words. I
committed<br>
 them to memory on the spot, and as soon as circumstances set
me<br>
 free to do so, I noted them down on a piece of paper. I believe
I<br>
 have it here." He fumbled in his breast-pocket, bringing out
mild<br>
 things, note-books, circulars and programmes of village
concerts.<br>
 "I heard Miss Mowbray say to Miss James, the following
words:<br>
 `Now's your time, Bill.'"</p>

<p>He gazed at me for a few moments after making this
announcement,<br>
 gravely and unflinchingly, as if conscious that here he was<br>
 unshaken about his facts. Then he resumed, turning his bald
head<br>
 more towards the fire.</p>

<p>"This appeared to me remarkable. I could not by any means<br>
 understand it. It seemed to me first of all peculiar that
one<br>
 maiden lady should address another maiden lady as `Bill'. My<br>
 experience, as I have said, may be incomplete; maiden ladies
may<br>
 have among themselves and in exclusively spinster circles
wilder<br>
 customs than I am aware of. But it seemed to me odd, and I
could<br>
 almost have sworn (if you will not misunderstand the phrase),
I<br>
 should have been strongly impelled to maintain at the time
that<br>
 the words, `Now's your time, Bill', were by no means
pronounced<br>
 with that upper-class intonation which, as I have already
said,<br>
 had up to now characterized Miss Mowbray's conversation. In
fact,<br>
 the words, `Now's your time, Bill', would have been, I
fancy,<br>
 unsuitable if pronounced with that upper-class intonation.</p>

<p>"I was surprised, I repeat, then, at the remark. But I was
still<br>
 more surprised when, looking round me in bewilderment, my hat
and<br>
 umbrella in hand, I saw the lean lady with the woollen shawl<br>
 leaning upright against the door out of which I was just about
to<br>
 make my exit. She was still knitting, and I supposed that
this<br>
 erect posture against the door was only an eccentricity of<br>
 spinsterhood and an oblivion of my intended departure.</p>

<p>"I said genially, `I am so sorry to disturb you, Miss James,
but I<br>
 must really be going. I have--er--' I stopped here, for the
words<br>
 she had uttered in reply, though singularly brief and in
tone<br>
 extremely business-like, were such as to render that arrest of
my<br>
 remarks, I think, natural and excusable. I have these words
also<br>
 noted down. I have not the least idea of their meaning; so I
have<br>
 only been able to render them phonetically. But she said," and
Mr<br>
 Shorter peered short-sightedly at his papers, "she said: `Chuck
it,<br>
 fat 'ead,' and she added something that sounded like `It's a
kop',<br>
 or (possibly) `a kopt'. And then the last cord, either of my
sanity<br>
 or the sanity of the universe, snapped suddenly. My esteemed
friend<br>
 and helper, Miss Brett, standing by the mantelpiece, said: `Put
'is<br>
 old 'ead in a bag, Sam, and tie 'im up before you start
jawin'.<br>
 You'll be kopt yourselves some o' these days with this way of
coin'<br>
 things, har lar theater.'</p>

<p>"My head went round and round. Was it really true, as I
had<br>
 suddenly fancied a moment before, that unmarried ladies had
some<br>
 dreadful riotous society of their own from which all others
were<br>
 excluded? I remembered dimly in my classical days (I was a
scholar<br>
 in a small way once, but now, alas! rusty), I remembered the<br>
 mysteries of the Bona Dea and their strange female freemasonry.
I<br>
 remembered the witches' Sabbaths. I was just, in my absurd<br>
 lightheadedness, trying to remember a line of verse about
Diana's<br>
 nymphs, when Miss Mowbray threw her arm round me from behind.
The<br>
 moment it held me I knew it was not a woman's arm.</p>

<p>"Miss Brett--or what I had called Miss Brett--was standing in
front<br>
 of me with a big revolver in her hand and a broad grin on her
face.<br>
 Miss James was still leaning against the door, but had fallen
into<br>
 an attitude so totally new, and so totally unfeminine, that it
gave<br>
 one a shock. She was kicking her heels, with her hands in
her<br>
 pockets and her cap on one side. She was a man. I mean he was
a<br>
 wo--no, that is I saw that instead of being a woman she--he,
I<br>
 mean--that is, it was a man."</p>

<p>Mr Shorter became indescribably flurried and flapping in<br>
 endeavouring to arrange these genders and his plaid shawl at
the<br>
 same time. He resumed with a higher fever of nervousness:</p>

<p>"As for Miss Mowbray, she--he, held me in a ring of iron. He
had<br>
 her arm--that is she had his arm--round her neck--my neck I
mean--<br>
 and I could not cry out. Miss Brett--that is, Mr Brett, at least
Mr<br>
 something who was not Miss Brett--had the revolver pointed at
me.<br>
 The other two ladies--or er--gentlemen, were rummaging in some
bag<br>
 in the background. It was all clear at last: they were
criminals<br>
 dressed up as women, to kidnap me! To kidnap the Vicar of
Chuntsey,<br>
 in Essex. But why? Was it to be Nonconformists?</p>

<p>"The brute leaning against the door called out carelessly,
`'Urry<br>
 up, 'Arry. Show the old bloke what the game is, and let's get
off.'</p>

<p>"`Curse 'is eyes,' said Miss Brett--I mean the man with
the<br>
 revolver--`why should we show 'im the game?'</p>

<p>"`If you take my advice you bloomin' well will,' said the man
at<br>
 the door, whom they called Bill. `A man wot knows wet 'e's doin'
is<br>
 worth ten wot don't, even if 'e's a potty old parson.'</p>

<p>"`Bill's right enough,' said the coarse voice of the man who
held<br>
 me (it had been Miss Mowbray's). `Bring out the picture,
'Arry.'</p>

<p>"The man with the revolver walked across the room to where
the<br>
 other two women--I mean men--were turning over baggage, and
asked<br>
 them for something which they gave him. He came back with it
across<br>
 the room and held it out in front of me. And compared to the<br>
 surprise of that display, all the previous surprises of this
awful<br>
 day shrank suddenly.</p>

<p>"It was a portrait of myself. That such a picture should be in
the<br>
 hands of these scoundrels might in any case have caused a
mild<br>
 surprise; but no more. It was no mild surprise that I felt.
The<br>
 likeness was an extremely good one, worked up with all the<br>
 accessories of the conventional photographic studio. I was
leaning<br>
 my head on my hand and was relieved against a painted landscape
of<br>
 woodland. It was obvious that it was no snapshot; it was clear
that<br>
 I had sat for this photograph. And the truth was that I had
never<br>
 sat for such a photograph. It was a photograph that I had never
had<br>
 taken.</p>

<p>"I stared at it again and again. It seemed to me to be touched
up a<br>
 good deal; it was glazed as well as framed, and the glass
blurred<br>
 some of the details. But there unmistakably was my face, my
eyes,<br>
 my nose and mouth, my head and hand, posed for a
professional<br>
 photographer. And I had never posed so for any photographer.</p>

<p>"`Be'old the bloomin' miracle,' said the man with the
revolver,<br>
 with ill-timed facetiousness. `Parson, prepare to meet your
God.'<br>
 And with this he slid the glass out of the frame. As the
glass<br>
 moved, I saw that part of the picture was painted on it in
Chinese<br>
 white, notably a pair of white whiskers and a clerical collar.
And<br>
 underneath was a portrait of an old lady in a quiet black
dress,<br>
 leaning her head on her hand against the woodland landscape.
The<br>
 old lady was as like me as one pin is like another. It had
required<br>
 only the whiskers and the collar to make it me in every
hair.</p>

<p>"`Entertainin', ain't it?' said the man described as 'Arry, as
he<br>
 shot the glass back again. `Remarkable resemblance, parson.<br>
 Gratifyin' to the lady. Gratifyin' to you. And hi may hadd,<br>
 particlery gratifyin' to us, as bein' the probable source of
a<br>
 very tolerable haul. You know Colonel Hawker, the man who's
come<br>
 to live in these parts, don't you?'</p>

<p>"I nodded.</p>

<p>"`Well,' said the man 'Arry, pointing to the picture, `that's
'is<br>
 mother. 'Oo ran to catch 'im when 'e fell? She did,' and he
flung<br>
 his fingers in a general gesture towards the photograph of the
old<br>
 lady who was exactly like me.</p>

<p>"`Tell the old gent wot 'e's got to do and be done with it,'
broke<br>
 out Bill from the door. `Look 'ere, Reverend Shorter, we
ain't<br>
 goin' to do you no 'arm. We'll give you a sov. for your trouble
if<br>
 you like. And as for the old woman's clothes--why, you'll
look<br>
 lovely in 'em.'</p>

<p>"`You ain't much of a 'and at a description, Bill,' said the
man<br>
 behind me. `Mr Shorter, it's like this. We've got to see this
man<br>
 Hawker tonight. Maybe 'e'll kiss us all and 'ave up the
champagne<br>
 when 'e sees us. Maybe on the other 'and--'e won't. Maybe 'e'll
be<br>
 dead when we goes away. Maybe not. But we've got to see 'im. Now
as<br>
 you know, 'e shuts 'isself up and never opens the door to a
soul;<br>
 only you don't know why and we does. The only one as can ever
get<br>
 at 'im is 'is mother. Well, it's a confounded funny
coincidence,'<br>
 he said, accenting the penultimate, `it's a very unusual piece
of<br>
 good luck, but you're 'is mother.'</p>

<p>"`When first I saw 'er picture,' said the man Bill, shaking
his<br>
 head in a ruminant manner, `when I first saw it I said--old<br>
 Shorter. Those were my exact words--old Shorter.'</p>

<p>"`What do you mean, you wild creatures?' I gasped. `What am I
to<br>
 do?'</p>

<p>"`That's easy said, your 'oldness,' said the man with the
revolver,<br>
 good-humouredly; `you've got to put on those clothes,' and
he<br>
 pointed to a poke-bonnet and a heap of female clothes in the
corner<br>
 of the room.</p>

<p>"I will not dwell, Mr Swinburne, upon the details of what
followed.<br>
 I had no choice. I could not fight five men, to say nothing of
a<br>
 loaded pistol. In five minutes, sir, the Vicar of Chuntsey
was<br>
 dressed as an old woman--as somebody else's mother, if you<br>
 please--and was dragged out of the house to take part in a
crime.</p>

<p>"It was already late in the afternoon, and the nights of
winter<br>
 were closing in fast. On a dark road, in a blowing wind, we set
out<br>
 towards the lonely house of Colonel Hawker, perhaps the
queerest<br>
 cortege that ever straggled up that or any other road. To
every<br>
 human eye, in every external, we were six very respectable
old<br>
 ladies of small means, in black dresses and refined but
antiquated<br>
 bonnets; and we were really five criminals and a clergyman.</p>

<p>"I will cut a long story short. My brain was whirling like
a<br>
 windmill as I walked, trying to think of some manner of escape.
To<br>
 cry out, so long as we were far from houses, would be suicidal,
for<br>
 it would be easy for the ruffians to knife me or to gag me
and<br>
 fling me into a ditch. On the other hand, to attempt to stop<br>
 strangers and explain the situation was impossible, because of
the<br>
 frantic folly of the situation itself. Long before I had
persuaded<br>
 the chance postman or carrier of so absurd a story, my
companions<br>
 would certainly have got off themselves, and in all
probability<br>
 would have carried me off, as a friend of theirs who had the<br>
 misfortune to be mad or drunk. The last thought, however, was
an<br>
 inspiration; though a very terrible one. Had it come to this,
that<br>
 the Vicar of Chuntsey must pretend to be mad or drunk? It had
come<br>
 to this.</p>

<p><br>
 "I walked along with the rest up the deserted road, imitating
and<br>
 keeping pace, as far as I could, with their rapid and yet
lady-like<br>
 step, until at length I saw a lamp-post and a policeman
standing<br>
 under it. I had made up my mind. Until we reached them we were
all<br>
 equally demure and silent and swift. When we reached them I<br>
 suddenly flung myself against the railings and roared out:
`Hooray!<br>
 Hooray! Hooray! Rule Britannia! Get your 'air cut. Hoop-la!
Boo!'<br>
 It was a condition of no little novelty for a man in my
position.</p>

<p>"The constable instantly flashed his lantern on me, or the<br>
 draggled, drunken old woman that was my travesty. `Now then,
mum,'<br>
 he began gruffly.</p>

<p>"`Come along quiet, or I'll eat your heart,' cried Sam in my
ear<br>
 hoarsely. `Stop, or I'll flay you.' It was frightful to hear
the<br>
 words and see the neatly shawled old spinster who whispered
them.</p>

<p>"I yelled, and yelled--I was in for it now. I screamed
comic<br>
 refrains that vulgar young men had sung, to my regret, at
our<br>
 village concerts; I rolled to and fro like a ninepin about to
fall.</p>

<p>"`If you can't get your friend on quiet, ladies,' said the<br>
 policeman, `I shall have to take 'er up. Drunk and disorderly
she<br>
 is right enough.'</p>

<p>"I redoubled my efforts. I had not been brought up to this
sort of<br>
 thing; but I believe I eclipsed myself. Words that I did not
know I<br>
 had ever heard of seemed to come pouring out of my open
mouth.</p>

<p>"`When we get you past,' whispered Bill, `you'll howl
louder;<br>
 you'll howl louder when we're burning your feet off.'</p>

<p>"I screamed in my terror those awful songs of joy. In all
the<br>
 nightmares that men have ever dreamed, there has never been<br>
 anything so blighting and horrible as the faces of those five
men,<br>
 looking out of their poke-bonnets; the figures of district
visitors<br>
 with the faces of devils. I cannot think there is anything
so<br>
 heart-breaking in hell.</p>

<p>"For a sickening instant I thought that the bustle of my
companions<br>
 and the perfect respectability of all our dresses would
overcome<br>
 the policeman and induce him to let us pass. He wavered, so far
as<br>
 one can describe anything so solid as a policeman as wavering.
I<br>
 lurched suddenly forward and ran my head into his chest,
calling<br>
 out (if I remember correctly), `Oh, crikey, blimey, Bill.' It
was<br>
 at that moment that I remembered most dearly that I was the
Vicar<br>
 of Chuntsey, in Essex.</p>

<p>"My desperate coup saved me. The policeman had me hard by the
back<br>
 of the neck.</p>

<p>"`You come along with me,' he began, but Bill cut in with
his<br>
 perfect imitation of a lady's finnicking voice.</p>

<p>"`Oh, pray, constable, don't make a disturbance with our
poor<br>
 friend. We will get her quietly home. She does drink too much,
but<br>
 she is quite a lady--only eccentric.'</p>

<p>"`She butted me in the stomach,' said the policeman
briefly.</p>

<p>"`Eccentricities of genius,' said Sam earnestly.</p>

<p>"`Pray let me take her home,' reiterated Bill, in the
resumed<br>
 character of Miss James, `she wants looking after.' `She
does,'<br>
 said the policeman, `but I'll look after her.'</p>

<p>"`That's no good,' cried Bill feverishly. `She wants her
friends.<br>
 She wants a particular medicine we've got.'</p>

<p>"`Yes,' assented Miss Mowbray, with excitement, `no other
medicine<br>
 any good, constable. Complaint quite unique.'</p>

<p>"`I'm all righ'. Cutchy, cutchy, coo!' remarked, to his
eternal<br>
 shame, the Vicar of Chuntsey.</p>

<p>"`Look here, ladies,' said the constable sternly, `I don't
like the<br>
 eccentricity of your friend, and I don't like 'er songs, or
'er<br>
 'ead in my stomach. And now I come to think of it, I don't like
the<br>
 looks of you I've seen many as quiet dressed as you as was
wrong<br>
 'uns. Who are you?'</p>

<p>"`We've not our cards with us,' said Miss Mowbray, with<br>
 indescribable dignity. `Nor do we see why we should be insulted
by<br>
 any Jack-in-office who chooses to be rude to ladies, when he
is<br>
 paid to protect them. If you choose to take advantage of the<br>
 weakness of our unfortunate friend, no doubt you are legally<br>
 entitled to take her. But if you fancy you have any legal right
to<br>
 bully us, you will find yourself in the wrong box.'</p>

<p>"The truth and dignity of this staggered the policeman for
a<br>
 moment. Under cover of their advantage my five persecutors
turned<br>
 for an instant on me faces like faces of the damned and then<br>
 swished off into the darkness. When the constable first turned
his<br>
 lantern and his suspicions on to them, I had seen the
telegraphic<br>
 look flash from face to face saying that only retreat was
possible<br>
 now.</p>

<p>"By this time I was sinking slowly to the pavement, in a state
of<br>
 acute reflection. So long as the ruffians were with me, I dared
not<br>
 quit the role of drunkard. For if I had begun to talk
reasonably<br>
 and explain the real case, the officer would merely have
thought<br>
 that I was slightly recovered and would have put me in charge of
my<br>
 friends. Now, however, if I liked I might safely undeceive
him.</p>

<p>"But I confess I did not like. The chances of life are many,
and<br>
 it may doubtless sometimes lie in the narrow path of duty for
a<br>
 clergyman of the Church of England to pretend to be a drunken
old<br>
 woman; but such necessities are, I imagine, sufficiently rare
to<br>
 appear to many improbable. Suppose the story got about that I
had<br>
 pretended to be drunk. Suppose people did not all think it
was<br>
 pretence!</p>

<p>"I lurched up, the policeman half-lifting me. I went along
weakly<br>
 and quietly for about a hundred yards. The officer evidently<br>
 thought that I was too sleepy and feeble to effect an escape,
and<br>
 so held me lightly and easily enough. Past one turning, two<br>
 turnings, three turnings, four turnings, he trailed me with
him,<br>
 a limp and slow and reluctant figure. At the fourth turning,
I<br>
 suddenly broke from his hand and tore down the street like a<br>
 maddened stag. He was unprepared, he was heavy, and it was
dark.<br>
 I ran and ran and ran, and in five minutes' running, found I
was<br>
 gaining. In half an hour I was out in the fields under the
holy<br>
 and blessed stars, where I tore off my accursed shawl and
bonnet<br>
 and buried them in clean earth."</p>

<p>The old gentleman had finished his story and leant back in
his<br>
 chair. Both the matter and the manner of his narration had,
as<br>
 time went on, impressed me favourably. He was an old duffer
and<br>
 pedant, but behind these things he was a country-bred man
and<br>
 gentleman, and had showed courage and a sporting instinct in
the<br>
 hour of desperation. He had told his story with many quaint<br>
 formalities of diction, but also with a very convincing
realism.</p>

<p>"And now--" I began.</p>

<p>"And now," said Shorter, leaning forward again with something
like<br>
 servile energy, "and now, Mr Swinburne, what about that
unhappy<br>
 man Hawker. I cannot tell what those men meant, or how far
what<br>
 they said was real. But surely there is danger. I cannot go to
the<br>
 police, for reasons that you perceive. Among other things,
they<br>
 wouldn't believe me. What is to be done?"</p>

<p>I took out my watch. It was already half past twelve.</p>

<p>"My friend Basil Grant," I said, "is the best man we can go
to. He<br>
 and I were to have gone to the same dinner tonight; but he
will<br>
 just have come back by now. Have you any objection to taking
a<br>
 cab?"</p>

<p>"Not at all," he replied, rising politely, and gathering up
his<br>
 absurd plaid shawl.</p>

<p>A rattle in a hansom brought us underneath the sombre pile
of<br>
 workmen's flats in Lambeth which Grant inhabited; a climb up
a<br>
 wearisome wooden staircase brought us to his garret. When I<br>
 entered that wooden and scrappy interior, the white gleam of<br>
 Basil's shirt-front and the lustre of his fur coat flung on
the<br>
 wooden settle, struck me as a contrast. He was drinking a
glass<br>
 of wine before retiring. I was right; he had come back from
the<br>
 dinner-party.</p>

<p>He listened to the repetition of the story of the Rev.
Ellis<br>
 Shorter with the genuine simplicity and respect which he
never<br>
 failed to exhibit in dealing with any human being. When it
was<br>
 over he said simply:</p>

<p>"Do you know a man named Captain Fraser?"</p>

<p>I was so startled at this totally irrelevant reference to
the<br>
 worthy collector of chimpanzees with whom I ought to have
dined<br>
 that evening, that I glanced sharply at Grant. The result
was<br>
 that I did not look at Mr Shorter. I only heard him answer,
in<br>
 his most nervous tone, "No."</p>

<p>Basil, however, seemed to find something very curious about
his<br>
 answer or his demeanour generally, for he kept his big blue
eyes<br>
 fixed on the old clergyman, and though the eyes were quite
quiet<br>
 they stood out more and more from his head.</p>

<p>"You are quite sure, Mr Shorter," he repeated, "that you
don't<br>
 know Captain Fraser?"</p>

<p>"Quite," answered the vicar, and I was certainly puzzled
to<br>
 find him returning so much to the timidity, not to say the<br>
 demoralization, of his tone when he first entered my
presence.</p>

<p>Basil sprang smartly to his feet.</p>

<p>"Then our course is clear," he said. "You have not even begun
your<br>
 investigation, my dear Mr Shorter; the first thing for us to do
is<br>
 to go together to see Captain Fraser."</p>

<p>"When?" asked the clergyman, stammering.</p>

<p>"Now," said Basil, putting one arm in his fur coat.</p>

<p>The old clergyman rose to his feet, quaking all over.</p>

<p>"I really do not think that it is necessary," he said.</p>

<p>Basil took his arm out of the fur coat, threw it over the
chair<br>
 again, and put his hands in his pockets.</p>

<p>"Oh," he said, with emphasis. "Oh--you don't think it
necessary;<br>
 then," and he added the words with great clearness and<br>
 deliberation, "then, Mr Ellis Shorter, I can only say that I
would<br>
 like to see you without your whiskers."</p>

<p>And at these words I also rose to my feet, for the great
tragedy<br>
 of my life had come. Splendid and exciting as life was in<br>
 continual contact with an intellect like Basil's, I had always
the<br>
 feeling that that splendour and excitement were on the
borderland<br>
 of sanity. He lived perpetually near the vision of the reason
of<br>
 things which makes men lose their reason. And I felt of his<br>
 insanity as men feel of the death of friends with heart
disease.<br>
 It might come anywhere, in a field, in a hansom cab, looking at
a<br>
 sunset, smoking a cigarette. It had come now. At the very
moment<br>
 of delivering a judgement for the salvation of a fellow
creature,<br>
 Basil Grant had gone mad.</p>

<p>"Your whiskers," he cried, advancing with blazing eyes. "Give
me<br>
 your whiskers. And your bald head."</p>

<p>The old vicar naturally retreated a step or two. I stepped<br>
 between.</p>

<p>"Sit down, Basil," I implored, "you're a little excited.
Finish<br>
 your wine."</p>

<p>"Whiskers," he answered sternly, "whiskers."</p>

<p>And with that he made a dash at the old gentleman, who made a
dash<br>
 for the door, but was intercepted. And then, before I knew where
I<br>
 was the quiet room was turned into something between a
pantomime<br>
 and a pandemonium by those two. Chairs were flung over with
a<br>
 crash, tables were vaulted with a noise like thunder, screens
were<br>
 smashed, crockery scattered in smithereens, and still Basil
Grant<br>
 bounded and bellowed after the Rev. Ellis Shorter.</p>

<p>And now I began to perceive something else, which added the
last<br>
 half-witted touch to my mystification. The Rev. Ellis Shorter,
of<br>
 Chuntsey, in Essex, was by no means behaving as I had
previously<br>
 noticed him to behave, or as, considering his age and station,
I<br>
 should have expected him to behave. His power of dodging,
leaping,<br>
 and fighting would have been amazing in a lad of seventeen, and
in<br>
 this doddering old vicar looked like a sort of farcical<br>
 fairy-tale. Moreover, he did not seem to be so much astonished
as<br>
 I had thought. There was even a look of something like
enjoyment<br>
 in his eyes; so there was in the eye of Basil. In fact, the<br>
 unintelligible truth must be told. They were both laughing.</p>

<p>At length Shorter was cornered.</p>

<p>"Come, come, Mr Grant," he panted, "you can't do anything to
me.<br>
 It's quite legal. And it doesn't do any one the least harm.
It's<br>
 only a social fiction. A result of our complex society, Mr
Grant."</p>

<p>"I don't blame you, my man," said Basil coolly. "But I want
your<br>
 whiskers. And your bald head. Do they belong to Captain
Fraser?"</p>

<p>"No, no," said Mr Shorter, laughing, "we provide them
ourselves.<br>
 They don't belong to Captain Fraser."</p>

<p>"What the deuce does all this mean?" I almost screamed. "Are
you<br>
 all in an infernal nightmare? Why should Mr Shorter's bald
head<br>
 belong to Captain Fraser? How could it? What the deuce has
Captain<br>
 Fraser to do with the affair? What is the matter with him?
You<br>
 dined with him, Basil."</p>

<p>"No," said Grant, "I didn't."</p>

<p>"Didn't you go to Mrs Thornton's dinner-party?" I asked,
staring.<br>
 "Why not?"</p>

<p>"Well," said Basil, with a slow and singular smile, "the fact
is I<br>
 was detained by a visitor. I have him, as a point of fact, in
my<br>
 bedroom."</p>

<p>"In your bedroom?" I repeated; but my imagination had reached
that<br>
 point when he might have said in his coal scuttle or his
waistcoat<br>
 pocket.</p>

<p>Grant stepped to the door of an inner room, flung it open
and<br>
 walked in. Then he came out again with the last of the
bodily<br>
 wonders of that wild night. He introduced into the
sitting-room,<br>
 in an apologetic manner, and by the nape of the neck, a limp<br>
 clergyman with a bald head, white whiskers and a plaid
shawl.</p>

<p>"Sit down, gentlemen," cried Grant, striking his hands
heartily.<br>
 "Sit down all of you and have a glass of wine. As you say, there
is<br>
 no harm in it, and if Captain Fraser had simply dropped me a
hint I<br>
 could have saved him from dropping a good sum of money. Not
that<br>
 you would have liked that, eh?"</p>

<p>The two duplicate clergymen, who were sipping their Burgundy
with<br>
 two duplicate grins, laughed heartily at this, and one of
them<br>
 carelessly pulled off his whiskers and laid them on the
table.</p>

<p>"Basil," I said, "if you are my friend, save me. What is all
this?"</p>

<p>He laughed again.</p>

<p>"Only another addition, Cherub, to your collection of Queer
Trades.<br>
 These two gentlemen (whose health I have now the pleasure of<br>
 drinking) are Professional Detainers."</p>

<p>"And what on earth's that?" I asked.</p>

<p>"It's really very simple, Mr Swinburne," began he who had
once<br>
 been the Rev. Ellis Shorter, of Chuntsey, in Essex; and it
gave<br>
 me a shock indescribable to hear out of that pompous and
familiar<br>
 form come no longer its own pompous and familiar voice, but
the<br>
 brisk sharp tones of a young city man. "It is really nothing
very<br>
 important. We are paid by our clients to detain in
conversation,<br>
 on some harmless pretext, people whom they want out of the
way<br>
 for a few hours. And Captain Fraser--" and with that he
hesitated<br>
 and smiled.</p>

<p>Basil smiled also. He intervened.</p>

<p>"The fact is that Captain Fraser, who is one of my best
friends,<br>
 wanted us both out of the way very much. He is sailing tonight
for<br>
 East Africa, and the lady with whom we were all to have dined
is--<br>
 er--what is I believe described as `the romance of his life'.
He<br>
 wanted that two hours with her, and employed these two
reverend<br>
 gentlemen to detain us at our houses so as to let him have
the<br>
 field to himself."</p>

<p>"And of course," said the late Mr Shorter apologetically to
me, "as<br>
 I had to keep a gentleman at home from keeping an appointment
with<br>
 a lady, I had to come with something rather hot and
strong--rather<br>
 urgent. It wouldn't have done to be tame."</p>

<p>"Oh," I said, "I acquit you of tameness."</p>

<p>"Thank you, sir," said the man respectfully, "always very
grateful<br>
 for any recommendation, sir."</p>

<p>The other man idly pushed back his artificial bald head,
revealing<br>
 close red hair, and spoke dreamily, perhaps under the influence
of<br>
 Basil's admirable Burgundy.</p>

<p>"It's wonderful how common it's getting, gentlemen. Our office
is<br>
 busy from morning till night. I've no doubt you've often
knocked<br>
 up against us before. You just take notice. When an old
bachelor<br>
 goes on boring you with hunting stories, when you're burning to
be<br>
 introduced to somebody, he's from our bureau. When a lady calls
on<br>
 parish work and stops hours, just when you wanted to go to
the<br>
 Robinsons', she's from our bureau. The Robinson hand, sir, may
be<br>
 darkly seen."</p>

<p>"There is one thing I don't understand," I said. "Why you are
both<br>
 vicars."</p>

<p>A shade crossed the brow of the temporary incumbent of
Chuntsey, in<br>
 Essex.</p>

<p>"That may have been a mistake, sir," he said. "But it was not
our<br>
 fault. It was all the munificence of Captain Fraser. He
requested<br>
 that the highest price and talent on our tariff should be
employed<br>
 to detain you gentlemen. Now the highest payment in our office
goes<br>
 to those who impersonate vicars, as being the most respectable
and<br>
 more of a strain. We are paid five guineas a visit. We have had
the<br>
 good fortune to satisfy the firm with our work; and we are
now<br>
 permanently vicars. Before that we had two years as colonels,
the<br>
 next in our scale. Colonels are four guineas."</p>

<h2>Chapter 4</h2>

<h3>The Singular Speculation of the House-Agent</h3>

<p>Lieutenant Drummond Keith was a man about whom conversation
always<br>
 burst like a thunderstorm the moment he left the room. This
arose<br>
 from many separate touches about him. He was a light, loose<br>
 person, who wore light, loose clothes, generally white, as if
he<br>
 were in the tropics; he was lean and graceful, like a panther,
and<br>
 he had restless black eyes.</p>

<p>He was very impecunious. He had one of the habits of the
poor,<br>
 in a degree so exaggerated as immeasurably to eclipse the
most<br>
 miserable of the unemployed; I mean the habit of continual
change<br>
 of lodgings. There are inland tracts of London where, in the
very<br>
 heart of artificial civilization, humanity has almost become<br>
 nomadic once more. But in that restless interior there was
no<br>
 ragged tramp so restless as the elegant officer in the loose
white<br>
 clothes. He had shot a great many things in his time, to
judge<br>
 from his conversation, from partridges to elephants, but his<br>
 slangier acquaintances were of opinion that "the moon" had
been<br>
 not unfrequently amid the victims of his victorious rifle.
The<br>
 phrase is a fine one, and suggests a mystic, elvish,
nocturnal<br>
 hunting.</p>

<p><br>
 He carried from house to house and from parish to parish a
kit<br>
 which consisted practically of five articles. Two
odd-looking,<br>
 large-bladed spears, tied together, the weapons, I suppose,
of<br>
 some savage tribe, a green umbrella, a huge and tattered copy
of<br>
 the Pickwick Papers, a big game rifle, and a large sealed jar
of<br>
 some unholy Oriental wine. These always went into every new<br>
 lodging, even for one night; and they went in quite
undisguised,<br>
 tied up in wisps of string or straw, to the delight of the
poetic<br>
 gutter boys in the little grey streets.</p>

<p>I had forgotten to mention that he always carried also his
old<br>
 regimental sword. But this raised another odd question about
him.<br>
 Slim and active as he was, he was no longer very young. His
hair,<br>
 indeed, was quite grey, though his rather wild almost
Italian<br>
 moustache retained its blackness, and his face was careworn
under<br>
 its almost Italian gaiety. To find a middle-aged man who has
left<br>
 the Army at the primitive rank of lieutenant is unusual and
not<br>
 necessarily encouraging. With the more cautious and solid
this<br>
 fact, like his endless flitting, did the mysterious gentleman
no<br>
 good.</p>

<p>Lastly, he was a man who told the kind of adventures which win
a<br>
 man admiration, but not respect. They came out of queer
places,<br>
 where a good man would scarcely find himself, out of opium dens
and<br>
 gambling hells; they had the heat of the thieves' kitchens
or<br>
 smelled of a strange smoke from cannibal incantations. These
are<br>
 the kind of stories which discredit a person almost equally
whether<br>
 they are believed or no. If Keith's tales were false he was a
liar;<br>
 if they were true he had had, at any rate, every opportunity
of<br>
 being a scamp.</p>

<p>He had just left the room in which I sat with Basil Grant and
his<br>
 brother Rupert, the voluble amateur detective. And as I say
was<br>
 invariably the case, we were all talking about him. Rupert
Grant<br>
 was a clever young fellow, but he had that tendency which youth
and<br>
 cleverness, when sharply combined, so often produce, a
somewhat<br>
 extravagant scepticism. He saw doubt and guilt everywhere, and
it<br>
 was meat and drink to him. I had often got irritated with
this<br>
 boyish incredulity of his, but on this particular occasion I
am<br>
 bound to say that I thought him so obviously right that I
was<br>
 astounded at Basil's opposing him, however banteringly.</p>

<p>I could swallow a good deal, being naturally of a simple turn,
but<br>
 I could not swallow Lieutenant Keith's autobiography.</p>

<p>"You don't seriously mean, Basil," I said, "that you think
that<br>
 that fellow really did go as a stowaway with Nansen and pretend
to<br>
 be the Mad Mullah and--"</p>

<p>"He has one fault," said Basil thoughtfully, "or virtue, as
you<br>
 may happen to regard it. He tells the truth in too exact and
bald<br>
 a style; he is too veracious."</p>

<p>"Oh! if you are going to be paradoxical," said Rupert<br>
 contemptuously, "be a bit funnier than that. Say, for
instance,<br>
 that he has lived all his life in one ancestral manor."</p>

<p>"No, he's extremely fond of change of scene," replied
Basil<br>
 dispassionately, "and of living in odd places. That doesn't<br>
 prevent his chief trait being verbal exactitude. What you
people<br>
 don't understand is that telling a thing crudely and coarsely
as<br>
 it happened makes it sound frightfully strange. The sort of
things<br>
 Keith recounts are not the sort of things that a man would make
up<br>
 to cover himself with honour; they are too absurd. But they
are<br>
 the sort of things that a man would do if he were
sufficiently<br>
 filled with the soul of skylarking."</p>

<p>"So far from paradox," said his brother, with something
rather<br>
 like a sneer, "you seem to be going in for journalese proverbs.
Do<br>
 you believe that truth is stranger than fiction?"</p>

<p>"Truth must of necessity be stranger than fiction," said
Basil<br>
 placidly. "For fiction is the creation of the human mind,
and<br>
 therefore is congenial to it."</p>

<p>"Well, your lieutenant's truth is stranger, if it is truth,
than<br>
 anything I ever heard of," said Rupert, relapsing into
flippancy.<br>
 "Do you, on your soul, believe in all that about the shark and
the<br>
 camera?"</p>

<p>"I believe Keith's words," answered the other. "He is an
honest<br>
 man."</p>

<p>"I should like to question a regiment of his landladies,"
said<br>
 Rupert cynically.</p>

<p>"I must say, I think you can hardly regard him as
unimpeachable<br>
 merely in himself," I said mildly; "his mode of life--"</p>

<p>Before I could complete the sentence the door was flung open
and<br>
 Drummond Keith appeared again on the threshold, his white
Panama<br>
 on his head.</p>

<p>"I say, Grant," he said, knocking off his cigarette ash
against<br>
 the door, "I've got no money in the world till next April.
Could<br>
 you lend me a hundred pounds? There's a good chap."</p>

<p>Rupert and I looked at each other in an ironical silence.
Basil,<br>
 who was sitting by his desk, swung the chair round idly on
its<br>
 screw and picked up a quill-pen.</p>

<p>"Shall I cross it?" he asked, opening a cheque-book.</p>

<p>"Really," began Rupert, with a rather nervous loudness,
"since<br>
 Lieutenant Keith has seen fit to make this suggestion to
Basil<br>
 before his family, I--"</p>

<p>"Here you are, Ugly," said Basil, fluttering a cheque in
the<br>
 direction of the quite nonchalant officer. "Are you in a
hurry?"</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Keith, in a rather abrupt way. "As a matter of
fact<br>
 I want it now. I want to see my--er--business man."</p>

<p>Rupert was eyeing him sarcastically, and I could see that it
was<br>
 on the tip of his tongue to say, inquiringly, "Receiver of
stolen<br>
 goods, perhaps." What he did say was:</p>

<p>"A business man? That's rather a general description,
Lieutenant<br>
 Keith."</p>

<p>Keith looked at him sharply, and then said, with something
rather<br>
 like ill-temper:</p>

<p>"He's a thingum-my-bob, a house-agent, say. I'm going to see
him."</p>

<p>"Oh, you're going to see a house-agent, are you?" said Rupert
Grant<br>
 grimly. "Do you know, Mr Keith, I think I should very much like
to<br>
 go with you?"</p>

<p>Basil shook with his soundless laughter. Lieutenant Keith
started<br>
 a little; his brow blackened sharply.</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon," he said. "What did you say?"</p>

<p>Rupert's face had been growing from stage to stage of
ferocious<br>
 irony, and he answered:</p>

<p>"I was saying that I wondered whether you would mind our
strolling<br>
 along with you to this house-agent's."</p>

<p>The visitor swung his stick with a sudden whirling
violence.</p>

<p>"Oh, in God's name, come to my house-agent's! Come to my
bedroom.<br>
 Look under my bed. Examine my dust-bin. Come along!" And with
a<br>
 furious energy which took away our breath he banged his way out
of<br>
 the room.</p>

<p>Rupert Grant, his restless blue eyes dancing with his
detective<br>
 excitement, soon shouldered alongside him, talking to him with
that<br>
 transparent camaraderie which he imagined to be appropriate
from<br>
 the disguised policeman to the disguised criminal. His<br>
 interpretation was certainly corroborated by one particular
detail,<br>
 the unmistakable unrest, annoyance, and nervousness of the man
with<br>
 whom he walked. Basil and I tramped behind, and it was not<br>
 necessary for us to tell each other that we had both noticed
this.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Drummond Keith led us through very extraordinary
and<br>
 unpromising neighbourhoods in the search for his remarkable<br>
 house-agent. Neither of the brothers Grant failed to notice
this<br>
 fact. As the streets grew closer and more crooked and the
roofs<br>
 lower and the gutters grosser with mud, a darker curiosity
deepened<br>
 on the brows of Basil, and the figure of Rupert seen from
behind<br>
 seemed to fill the street with a gigantic swagger of success.
At<br>
 length, at the end of the fourth or fifth lean grey street in
that<br>
 sterile district, we came suddenly to a halt, the mysterious<br>
 lieutenant looking once more about him with a sort of sulky<br>
 desperation. Above a row of shutters and a door, all
indescribably<br>
 dingy in appearance and in size scarce sufficient even for a
penny<br>
 toyshop, ran the inscription: "P. Montmorency, House-Agent."</p>

<p>"This is the office of which I spoke," said Keith, in a
cutting<br>
 voice. "Will you wait here a moment, or does your
astonishing<br>
 tenderness about my welfare lead you to wish to overhear
everything<br>
 I have to say to my business adviser?"</p>

<p>Rupert's face was white and shaking with excitement; nothing
on<br>
 earth would have induced him now to have abandoned his prey.</p>

<p>"If you will excuse me," he said, clenching his hands behind
his<br>
 back, "I think I should feel myself justified in--"</p>

<p>"Oh! Come along in," exploded the lieutenant. He made the
same<br>
 gesture of savage surrender. And he slammed into the office,
the<br>
 rest of us at his heels.</p>

<p>P. Montmorency, House-Agent, was a solitary old gentleman
sitting<br>
 behind a bare brown counter. He had an egglike head, froglike
jaws,<br>
 and a grey hairy fringe of aureole round the lower part of
his<br>
 face; the whole combined with a reddish, aquiline nose. He wore
a<br>
 shabby black frock-coat, a sort of semi-clerical tie worn at a
very<br>
 unclerical angle, and looked, generally speaking, about as
unlike a<br>
 house-agent as anything could look, short of something like
a<br>
 sandwich man or a Scotch Highlander.</p>

<p>We stood inside the room for fully forty seconds, and the odd
old<br>
 gentleman did not look at us. Neither, to tell the truth, odd as
he<br>
 was, did we look at him. Our eyes were fixed, where his were
fixed,<br>
 upon something that was crawling about on the counter in front
of<br>
 him. It was a ferret.</p>

<p>The silence was broken by Rupert Grant. He spoke in that sweet
and<br>
 steely voice which he reserved for great occasions and
practised<br>
 for hours together in his bedroom. He said:</p>

<p>"Mr Montmorency, I think?"</p>

<p>The old gentleman started, lifted his eyes with a bland<br>
 bewilderment, picked up the ferret by the neck, stuffed it
alive<br>
 into his trousers pocket, smiled apologetically, and said:</p>

<p>"Sir."</p>

<p>"You are a house-agent, are you not?" asked Rupert.</p>

<p>To the delight of that criminal investigator, Mr Montmorency's
eyes<br>
 wandered unquietly towards Lieutenant Keith, the only man
present<br>
 that he knew.</p>

<p>"A house-agent," cried Rupert again, bringing out the word as
if it<br>
 were "burglar'.</p>

<p>"Yes . . . oh, yes," said the man, with a quavering and
almost<br>
 coquettish smile. "I am a house-agent . . . oh, yes."</p>

<p>"Well, I think," said Rupert, with a sardonic sleekness,
"that<br>
 Lieutenant Keith wants to speak to you. We have come in by
his<br>
 request."</p>

<p>Lieutenant Keith was lowering gloomily, and now he spoke.</p>

<p>"I have come, Mr Montmorency, about that house of mine."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," said Montmorency, spreading his fingers on the
flat<br>
 counter. "It's all ready, sir. I've attended to all your<br>
 suggestions er--about the br--"</p>

<p>"Right," cried Keith, cutting the word short with the
startling<br>
 neatness of a gunshot. "We needn't bother about all that. If<br>
 you've done what I told you, all right."</p>

<p>And he turned sharply towards the door.</p>

<p>Mr Montmorency, House-Agent, presented a picture of pathos.
After<br>
 stammering a moment he said: "Excuse me . . . Mr Keith . . .
there<br>
 was another matter . . . about which I wasn't quite sure. I
tried<br>
 to get all the heating apparatus possible under the
circumstances<br>
 . . . but in winter . . . at that elevation . . ."</p>

<p>"Can't expect much, eh?" said the lieutenant, cutting in
with<br>
 the same sudden skill. "No, of course not. That's all right,<br>
 Montmorency. There can't be any more difficulties," and he
put<br>
 his hand on the handle of the door.</p>

<p>"I think," said Rupert Grant, with a satanic suavity, "that
Mr<br>
 Montmorency has something further to say to you,
lieutenant."</p>

<p>"Only," said the house-agent, in desperation, "what about
the<br>
 birds?"</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon," said Rupert, in a general blank.</p>

<p>"What about the birds?" said the house-agent doggedly.</p>

<p>Basil, who had remained throughout the procedings in a state
of<br>
 Napoleonic calm, which might be more accurately described as
a<br>
 state of Napoleonic stupidity, suddenly lifted his leonine
head.</p>

<p>"Before you go, Lieutenant Keith," he said. "Come now.
Really,<br>
 what about the birds?"</p>

<p>"I'll take care of them," said Lieutenant Keith, still with
his<br>
 long back turned to us; "they shan't suffer."</p>

<p>"Thank you, sir, thank you," cried the incomprehensible<br>
 house-agent, with an air of ecstasy. "You'll excuse my
concern,<br>
 sir. You know I'm wild on wild animals. I'm as wild as any
of<br>
 them on that. Thank you, sir. But there's another thing. .
."</p>

<p>The lieutenant, with his back turned to us, exploded with
an<br>
 indescribable laugh and swung round to face us. It was a
laugh,<br>
 the purport of which was direct and essential, and yet which
one<br>
 cannot exactly express. As near as it said anything,
verbally<br>
 speaking, it said: "Well, if you must spoil it, you must. But
you<br>
 don't know what you're spoiling."</p>

<p>"There is another thing," continued Mr Montmorency weakly.
"Of<br>
 course, if you don't want to be visited you'll paint the
house<br>
 green, but--"</p>

<p>"Green!" shouted Keith. "Green! Let it be green or nothing.
I<br>
 won't have a house of another colour. Green!" and before we
could<br>
 realize anything the door had banged between us and the
street.</p>

<p>Rupert Grant seemed to take a little time to collect himself;
but<br>
 he spoke before the echoes of the door died away.</p>

<p>"Your client, Lieutenant Keith, appears somewhat excited,"
he<br>
 said. "What is the matter with him? Is he unwell?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I should think not," said Mr Montmorency, in some
confusion.<br>
 "The negotiations have been somewhat difficult--the house is<br>
 rather--"</p>

<p>"Green," said Rupert calmly. "That appears to be a very
important<br>
 point. It must be rather green. May I ask you, Mr
Montmorency,<br>
 before I rejoin my companion outside, whether, in your
business,<br>
 it is usual to ask for houses by their colour? Do clients
write<br>
 to a house-agent asking for a pink house or a blue house? Or,
to<br>
 take another instance, for a green house?"</p>

<p>"Only," said Montmorency, trembling, "only to be
inconspicuous."</p>

<p>Rupert had his ruthless smile. "Can you tell me any place on
earth<br>
 in which a green house would be inconspicuous?"</p>

<p>The house-agent was fidgeting nervously in his pocket.
Slowly<br>
 drawing out a couple of lizards and leaving them to run on
the<br>
 counter, he said:</p>

<p>"No; I can't."</p>

<p>"You can't suggest an explanation?"</p>

<p>"No," said Mr Montmorency, rising slowly and yet in such a way
as<br>
 to suggest a sudden situation, "I can't. And may I, as a busy
man,<br>
 be excused if I ask you, gentlemen, if you have any demand to
make<br>
 of me in connection with my business. What kind of house would
you<br>
 desire me to get for you, sir?"</p>

<p>He opened his blank blue eyes on Rupert, who seemed for the
second<br>
 staggered. Then he recovered himself with perfect common sense
and<br>
 answered:</p>

<p>"I am sorry, Mr Montmorency. The fascination of your remarks
has<br>
 unduly delayed us from joining our friend outside. Pray excuse
my<br>
 apparent impertinence."</p>

<p>"Not at all, sir," said the house-agent, taking a South
American<br>
 spider idly from his waistcoat pocket and letting it climb up
the<br>
 slope of his desk. "Not at all, sir. I hope you will favour
me<br>
 again."</p>

<p>Rupert Grant dashed out of the office in a gust of anger,
anxious<br>
 to face Lieutenant Keith. He was gone. The dull, starlit street
was<br>
 deserted.</p>

<p>"What do you say now?" cried Rupert to his brother. His
brother<br>
 said nothing now.</p>

<p>We all three strode down the street in silence, Rupert
feverish,<br>
 myself dazed, Basil, to all appearance, merely dull. We
walked<br>
 through grey street after grey street, turning corners,
traversing<br>
 squares, scarcely meeting anyone, except occasional drunken
knots<br>
 of two or three.</p>

<p>In one small street, however, the knots of two or three
began<br>
 abruptly to thicken into knots of five or six and then into
great<br>
 groups and then into a crowd. The crowd was stirring very
slightly.<br>
 But anyone with a knowledge of the eternal populace knows that
if<br>
 the outside rim of a crowd stirs ever so slightly it means
that<br>
 there is madness in the heart and core of the mob. It soon
became<br>
 evident that something really important had happened in the
centre<br>
 of this excitement. We wormed our way to the front, with the<br>
 cunning which is known only to cockneys, and once there we
soon<br>
 learned the nature of the difficulty. There had been a brawl<br>
 concerned with some six men, and one of them lay almost dead on
the<br>
 stones of the street. Of the other four, all interesting
matters<br>
 were, as far as we were concerned, swallowed up in one
stupendous<br>
 fact. One of the four survivors of the brutal and perhaps
fatal<br>
 scuffle was the immaculate Lieutenant Keith, his clothes torn
to<br>
 ribbons, his eyes blazing, blood on his knuckles. One other
thing,<br>
 however, pointed at him in a worse manner. A short sword, or
very<br>
 long knife, had been drawn out of his elegant walking-stick,
and<br>
 lay in front of him upon the stones. It did not, however, appear
to<br>
 be bloody.</p>

<p>The police had already pushed into the centre with their
ponderous<br>
 omnipotence, and even as they did so, Rupert Grant sprang
forward<br>
 with his incontrollable and intolerable secret.</p>

<p>"That is the man, constable," he shouted, pointing at the
battered<br>
 lieutenant. "He is a suspicious character. He did the
murder."</p>

<p>"There's been no murder done, sir," said the policeman, with
his<br>
 automatic civility. "The poor man's only hurt. I shall only
be<br>
 able to take the names and addresses of the men in the
scuffle<br>
 and have a good eye kept on them."</p>

<p>"Have a good eye kept on that one," said Rupert, pale to the
lips,<br>
 and pointing to the ragged Keith.</p>

<p>"All right, sir," said the policeman unemotionally, and went
the<br>
 round of the people present, collecting the addresses. When he
had<br>
 completed his task the dusk had fallen and most of the people
not<br>
 immediately connected with the examination had gone away. He
still<br>
 found, however, one eager-faced stranger lingering on the<br>
 outskirts of the affair. It was Rupert Grant.</p>

<p>"Constable," he said, "I have a very particular reason for
asking<br>
 you a question. Would you mind telling me whether that
military<br>
 fellow who dropped his sword-stick in the row gave you an
address<br>
 or not?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," said the policeman, after a reflective pause;
"yes, he<br>
 gave me his address."</p>

<p>"My name is Rupert Grant," said that individual, with some
pomp.<br>
 "I have assisted the police on more than one occasion. I
wonder<br>
 whether you would tell me, as a special favour, what
address?"</p>

<p>The constable looked at him.</p>

<p>"Yes," he said slowly, "if you like. His address is: The
Elms,<br>
 Buxton Common, near Purley, Surrey."</p>

<p>"Thank you," said Rupert, and ran home through the gathering
night<br>
 as fast as his legs could carry him, repeating the address
to<br>
 himself.</p>

<p>Rupert Grant generally came down late in a rather lordly way
to<br>
 breakfast; he contrived, I don't know how, to achieve always
the<br>
 attitude of the indulged younger brother. Next morning,
however,<br>
 when Basil and I came down we found him ready and restless.</p>

<p>"Well," he said sharply to his brother almost before we sat
down to<br>
 the meal. "What do you think of your Drummond Keith now?"</p>

<p>"What do I think of him?" inquired Basil slowly. "I don't
think<br>
 anything of him."</p>

<p>"I'm glad to hear it," said Rupert, buttering his toast with
an<br>
 energy that was somewhat exultant. "I thought you'd come round
to<br>
 my view, but I own I was startled at your not seeing it from
the<br>
 beginning. The man is a translucent liar and knave."</p>

<p>"I think," said Basil, in the same heavy monotone as before,
"that<br>
 I did not make myself clear. When I said that I thought nothing
of<br>
 him I meant grammatically what I said. I meant that I did not
think<br>
 about him; that he did not occupy my mind. You, however, seem to
me<br>
 to think a lot of him, since you think him a knave. I should say
he<br>
 was glaringly good myself."</p>

<p>"I sometimes think you talk paradox for its own sake," said
Rupert,<br>
 breaking an egg with unnecessary sharpness. "What the deuce is
the<br>
 sense of it? Here's a man whose original position was, by
our<br>
 common agreement, dubious. He's a wanderer, a teller of tall
tales,<br>
 a man who doesn't conceal his acquaintance with all the
blackest<br>
 and bloodiest scenes on earth. We take the trouble to follow him
to<br>
 one of his appointments, and if ever two human beings were
plotting<br>
 together and lying to every one else, he and that impossible<br>
 house-agent were doing it. We followed him home, and the very
same<br>
 night he is in the thick of a fatal, or nearly fatal, brawl,
in<br>
 which he is the only man armed. Really, if this is being
glaringly<br>
 good, I must confess that the glare does not dazzle me."</p>

<p>Basil was quite unmoved. "I admit his moral goodness is of
a<br>
 certain kind, a quaint, perhaps a casual kind. He is very fond
of<br>
 change and experiment. But all the points you so ingeniously
make<br>
 against him are mere coincidence or special pleading. It's true
he<br>
 didn't want to talk about his house business in front of us.
No<br>
 man would. It's true that he carries a sword-stick. Any man
might.<br>
 It's true he drew it in the shock of a street fight. Any man<br>
 would. But there's nothing really dubious in all this.
There's<br>
 nothing to confirm--"</p>

<p>As he spoke a knock came at the door.</p>

<p>"If you please, sir," said the landlady, with an alarmed
air,<br>
 "there's a policeman wants to see you."</p>

<p>"Show him in," said Basil, amid the blank silence.</p>

<p>The heavy, handsome constable who appeared at the door
spoke<br>
 almost as soon as he appeared there.</p>

<p>"I think one of you gentlemen," he said, curtly but
respectfully,<br>
 "was present at the affair in Copper Street last night, and
drew<br>
 my attention very strongly to a particular man."</p>

<p>Rupert half rose from his chair, with eyes like diamonds, but
the<br>
 constable went on calmly, referring to a paper.</p>

<p>"A young man with grey hair. Had light grey clothes, very
good, but<br>
 torn in the struggle. Gave his name as Drummond Keith."</p>

<p>"This is amusing," said Basil, laughing. "I was in the very
act of<br>
 clearing that poor officer's character of rather fanciful<br>
 aspersions. What about him?"</p>

<p>"Well, sir," said the constable, "I took all the men's
addresses<br>
 and had them all watched. It wasn't serious enough to do more
than<br>
 that. All the other addresses are all right. But this man
Keith<br>
 gave a false address. The place doesn't exist."</p>

<p>The breakfast table was nearly flung over as Rupert sprang
up,<br>
 slapping both his thighs.</p>

<p>"Well, by all that's good," he cried. "This is a sign from
heaven."</p>

<p>"It's certainly very extraordinary," said Basil quietly,
with<br>
 knitted brows. "It's odd the fellow should have given a
false<br>
 address, considering he was perfectly innocent in the--"</p>

<p>"Oh, you jolly old early Christian duffer," cried Rupert, in
a<br>
 sort of rapture, "I don't wonder you couldn't be a judge.
You<br>
 think every one as good as yourself. Isn't the thing plain
enough<br>
 now? A doubtful acquaintance; rowdy stories, a most
suspicious<br>
 conversation, mean streets, a concealed knife, a man nearly<br>
 killed, and, finally, a false address. That's what we call
glaring<br>
 goodness."</p>

<p>"It's certainly very extraordinary," repeated Basil. And
he<br>
 strolled moodily about the room. Then he said: "You are
quite<br>
 sure, constable, that there's no mistake? You got the
address<br>
 right, and the police have really gone to it and found it was
a<br>
 fraud?"</p>

<p>"It was very simple, sir," said the policeman, chuckling.
"The<br>
 place he named was a well-known common quite near London, and
our<br>
 people were down there this morning before any of you were
awake.<br>
 And there's no such house. In fact, there are hardly any houses
at<br>
 all. Though it is so near London, it's a blank moor with
hardly<br>
 five trees on it, to say nothing of Christians. Oh, no, sir,
the<br>
 address was a fraud right enough. He was a clever rascal,
and<br>
 chose one of those scraps of lost England that people know
nothing<br>
 about. Nobody could say off-hand that there was not a
particular<br>
 house dropped somewhere about the heath. But as a fact,
there<br>
 isn't."</p>

<p>Basil's face during this sensible speech had been growing
darker<br>
 and darker with a sort of desperate sagacity. He was
cornered<br>
 almost for the first time since I had known him; and to tell
the<br>
 truth I rather wondered at the almost childish obstinacy which
kept<br>
 him so close to his original prejudice in favour of the
wildly<br>
 questionable lieutenant. At length he said:</p>

<p>"You really searched the common? And the address was really
not<br>
 known in the district--by the way, what was the address?"</p>

<p>The constable selected one of his slips of paper and consulted
it,<br>
 but before he could speak Rupert Grant, who was leaning in
the<br>
 window in a perfect posture of the quiet and triumphant
detective,<br>
 struck in with the sharp and suave voice he loved so much to
use.</p>

<p>"Why, I can tell you that, Basil," he said graciously as he
idly<br>
 plucked leaves from a plant in the window. "I took the
precaution<br>
 to get this man's address from the constable last night."</p>

<p>"And what was it?" asked his brother gruffly.</p>

<p>"The constable will correct me if I am wrong," said
Rupert,<br>
 looking sweetly at the ceiling. "It was: The Elms, Buxton<br>
 Common, near Purley, Surrey."</p>

<p>"Right, sir," said the policeman, laughing and folding up
his<br>
 papers.</p>

<p>There was a silence, and the blue eyes of Basil looked blindly
for<br>
 a few seconds into the void. Then his head fell back in his
chair<br>
 so suddenly that I started up, thinking him ill. But before I
could<br>
 move further his lips had flown apart (I can use no other
phrase)<br>
 and a peal of gigantic laughter struck and shook the
ceiling--<br>
 laughter that shook the laughter, laughter redoubled,
laughter<br>
 incurable, laughter that could not stop.</p>

<p>Two whole minutes afterwards it was still unended; Basil was
ill<br>
 with laughter; but still he laughed. The rest of us were by
this<br>
 time ill almost with terror.</p>

<p>"Excuse me," said the insane creature, getting at last to his
feet.<br>
 "I am awfully sorry. It is horribly rude. And stupid, too. And
also<br>
 unpractical, because we have not much time to lose if we're to
get<br>
 down to that place. The train service is confoundedly bad, as
I<br>
 happen to know. It's quite out of proportion to the
comparatively<br>
 small distance."</p>

<p>"Get down to that place?" I repeated blankly. "Get down to
what<br>
 place?"</p>

<p>"I have forgotten its name," said Basil vaguely, putting his
hands<br>
 in his pockets as he rose. "Something Common near Purley. Has
any<br>
 one got a timetable?"</p>

<p>"You don't seriously mean," cried Rupert, who had been staring
in<br>
 a sort of confusion of emotions. "You don't mean that you want
to<br>
 go to Buxton Common, do you? You can't mean that!"</p>

<p>"Why shouldn't I go to Buxton Common?" asked Basil,
smiling.</p>

<p>"Why should you?" said his brother, catching hold again
restlessly<br>
 of the plant in the window and staring at the speaker.</p>

<p>"To find our friend, the lieutenant, of course," said Basil
Grant.<br>
 "I thought you wanted to find him?"</p>

<p>Rupert broke a branch brutally from the plant and flung it<br>
 impatiently on the floor. "And in order to find him," he
said,<br>
 "you suggest the admirable expedient of going to the only
place<br>
 on the habitable earth where we know he can't be."</p>

<p>The constable and I could not avoid breaking into a kind
of<br>
 assenting laugh, and Rupert, who had family eloquence, was<br>
 encouraged to go on with a reiterated gesture:</p>

<p>"He may be in Buckingham Palace; he may be sitting astride
the<br>
 cross of St Paul's; he may be in jail (which I think most
likely);<br>
 he may be in the Great Wheel; he may be in my pantry; he may be
in<br>
 your store cupboard; but out of all the innumerable points
of<br>
 space, there is only one where he has just been
systematically<br>
 looked for and where we know that he is not to be found--and
that,<br>
 if I understand you rightly, is where you want us to go."</p>

<p>"Exactly," said Basil calmly, getting into his great-coat;
"I<br>
 thought you might care to accompany me. If not, of course,
make<br>
 yourselves jolly here till I come back."</p>

<p>It is our nature always to follow vanishing things and value
them<br>
 if they really show a resolution to depart. We all followed
Basil,<br>
 and I cannot say why, except that he was a vanishing thing,
that<br>
 he vanished decisively with his great-coat and his stick.
Rupert<br>
 ran after him with a considerable flurry of rationality.</p>

<p>"My dear chap," he cried, "do you really mean that you see any
good<br>
 in going down to this ridiculous scrub, where there is nothing
but<br>
 beaten tracks and a few twisted trees, simply because it was
the<br>
 first place that came into a rowdy lieutenant's head when he
wanted<br>
 to give a lying reference in a scrape?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Basil, taking out his watch, "and, what's worse,
we've<br>
 lost the train."</p>

<p>He paused a moment and then added: "As a matter of fact, I
think<br>
 we may just as well go down later in the day. I have some
writing<br>
 to do, and I think you told me, Rupert, that you thought of
going<br>
 to the Dulwich Gallery. I was rather too impetuous. Very likely
he<br>
 wouldn't be in. But if we get down by the 5.15, which gets
to<br>
 Purley about 6, I expect we shall just catch him."</p>

<p>"Catch him!" cried his brother, in a kind of final anger. "I
wish<br>
 we could. Where the deuce shall we catch him now?"</p>

<p>"I keep forgetting the name of the common," said Basil, as
he<br>
 buttoned up his coat. "The Elms--what is it? Buxton Common,
near<br>
 Purley. That's where we shall find him."</p>

<p>"But there is no such place," groaned Rupert; but he followed
his<br>
 brother downstairs.</p>

<p>We all followed him. We snatched our hats from the hat-stand
and<br>
 our sticks from the umbrella-stand; and why we followed him we
did<br>
 not and do not know. But we always followed him, whatever was
the<br>
 meaning of the fact, whatever was the nature of his mastery.
And<br>
 the strange thing was that we followed him the more completely
the<br>
 more nonsensical appeared the thing which he said. At bottom,
I<br>
 believe, if he had risen from our breakfast table and said: "I
am<br>
 going to find the Holy Pig with Ten Tails," we should have
followed<br>
 him to the end of the world.</p>

<p>I don't know whether this mystical feeling of mine about Basil
on<br>
 this occasion has got any of the dark and cloudy colour, so
to<br>
 speak, of the strange journey that we made the same evening. It
was<br>
 already very dense twilight when we struck southward from
Purley.<br>
 Suburbs and things on the London border may be, in most
cases,<br>
 commonplace and comfortable. But if ever by any chance they
really<br>
 are empty solitudes they are to the human spirit more desolate
and<br>
 dehumanized than any Yorkshire moors or Highland hills, because
the<br>
 suddenness with which the traveller drops into that silence
has<br>
 something about it as of evil elf-land. It seems to be one of
the<br>
 ragged suburbs of the cosmos half-forgotten by God--such a
place<br>
 was Buxton Common, near Purley.</p>

<p>There was certainly a sort of grey futility in the
landscape<br>
 itself. But it was enormously increased by the sense of grey<br>
 futility in our expedition. The tracts of grey turf looked<br>
 useless, the occasional wind-stricken trees looked useless,
but<br>
 we, the human beings, more useless than the hopeless turf or
the<br>
 idle trees. We were maniacs akin to the foolish landscape, for
we<br>
 were come to chase the wild goose which has led men and left
men<br>
 in bogs from the beginning. We were three dazed men under
the<br>
 captaincy of a madman going to look for a man whom we knew was
not<br>
 there in a house that had no existence. A livid sunset seemed
to<br>
 look at us with a sort of sickly smile before it died.</p>

<p>Basil went on in front with his coat collar turned up, looking
in<br>
 the gloom rather like a grotesque Napoleon. We crossed swell
after<br>
 swell of the windy common in increasing darkness and entire<br>
 silence. Suddenly Basil stopped and turned to us, his hands in
his<br>
 pockets. Through the dusk I could just detect that he wore a
broad<br>
 grin as of comfortable success.</p>

<p>"Well," he cried, taking his heavily gloved hands out of
his<br>
 pockets and slapping them together, "here we are at last."</p>

<p>The wind swirled sadly over the homeless heath; two desolate
elms<br>
 rocked above us in the sky like shapeless clouds of grey. There
was<br>
 not a sign of man or beast to the sullen circle of the horizon,
and<br>
 in the midst of that wilderness Basil Grant stood rubbing his
hands<br>
 with the air of an innkeeper standing at an open door.</p>

<p>"How jolly it is," he cried, "to get back to civilization.
That<br>
 notion that civilization isn't poetical is a civilised
delusion.<br>
 Wait till you've really lost yourself in nature, among the
devilish<br>
 woodlands and the cruel flowers. Then you'll know that there's
no<br>
 star like the red star of man that he lights on his hearthstone;
no<br>
 river like the red river of man, the good red wine, which you,
Mr<br>
 Rupert Grant, if I have any knowledge of you, will be drinking
in<br>
 two or three minutes in enormous quantities."</p>

<p>Rupert and I exchanged glances of fear. Basil went on
heartily, as<br>
 the wind died in the dreary trees.</p>

<p>"You'll find our host a much more simple kind of fellow in his
own<br>
 house. I did when I visited him when he lived in the cabin
at<br>
 Yarmouth, and again in the loft at the city warehouse. He's
really<br>
 a very good fellow. But his greatest virtue remains what I
said<br>
 originally."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" I asked, finding his speech straying
towards a<br>
 sort of sanity. "What is his greatest virtue?"</p>

<p>"His greatest virtue," replied Basil, "is that he always tells
the<br>
 literal truth."</p>

<p>"Well, really," cried Rupert, stamping about between cold
and<br>
 anger, and slapping himself like a cabman, "he doesn't seem to
have<br>
 been very literal or truthful in this case, nor you either. Why
the<br>
 deuce, may I ask, have you brought us out to this infernal
place?"</p>

<p>"He was too truthful, I confess," said Basil, leaning against
the<br>
 tree; "too hardly veracious, too severely accurate. He should
have<br>
 indulged in a little more suggestiveness and legitimate
romance.<br>
 But come, it's time we went in. We shall be late for
dinner."</p>

<p>Rupert whispered to me with a white face:</p>

<p>"Is it a hallucination, do you think? Does he really fancy he
sees<br>
 a house?"</p>

<p>"I suppose so," I said. Then I added aloud, in what was meant
to be<br>
 a cheery and sensible voice, but which sounded in my ears almost
as<br>
 strange as the wind:</p>

<p>"Come, come, Basil, my dear fellow. Where do you want us to
go?"</p>

<p>"Why, up here," cried Basil, and with a bound and a swing he
was<br>
 above our heads, swarming up the grey column of the colossal
tree.</p>

<p>"Come up, all of you," he shouted out of the darkness, with
the<br>
 voice of a schoolboy. "Come up. You'll be late for dinner."</p>

<p>The two great elms stood so close together that there was
scarcely<br>
 a yard anywhere, and in some places not more than a foot,
between<br>
 them. Thus occasional branches and even bosses and boles formed
a<br>
 series of footholds that almost amounted to a rude natural
ladder.<br>
 They must, I supposed, have been some sport of growth,
Siamese<br>
 twins of vegetation.</p>

<p>Why we did it I cannot think; perhaps, as I have said, the
mystery<br>
 of the waste and dark had brought out and made primary
something<br>
 wholly mystical in Basil's supremacy. But we only felt that
there<br>
 was a giant's staircase going somewhere, perhaps to the stars;
and<br>
 the victorious voice above called to us out of heaven. We
hoisted<br>
 ourselves up after him.</p>

<p><br>
 Half-way up some cold tongue of the night air struck and sobered
me<br>
 suddenly. The hypnotism of the madman above fell from me, and I
saw<br>
 the whole map of our silly actions as clearly as if it were<br>
 printed. I saw three modern men in black coats who had begun
with a<br>
 perfectly sensible suspicion of a doubtful adventurer and who
had<br>
 ended, God knows how, half-way up a naked tree on a naked
moorland,<br>
 far from that adventurer and all his works, that adventurer who
was<br>
 at that moment, in all probability, laughing at us in some
dirty<br>
 Soho restaurant. He had plenty to laugh at us about, and no
doubt<br>
 he was laughing his loudest; but when I thought what his
laughter<br>
 would be if he knew where we were at that moment, I nearly let
go<br>
 of the tree and fell.</p>

<p>"Swinburne," said Rupert suddenly, from above, "what are we
doing?<br>
 Let's get down again," and by the mere sound of his voice I
knew<br>
 that he too felt the shock of wakening to reality.</p>

<p>"We can't leave poor Basil," I said. "Can't you call to him or
get<br>
 hold of him by the leg?"</p>

<p>"He's too far ahead," answered Rupert; "he's nearly at the
top<br>
 of the beastly thing. Looking for Lieutenant Keith in the
rooks'<br>
 nests, I suppose."</p>

<p>We were ourselves by this time far on our frantic vertical<br>
 journey. The mighty trunks were beginning to sway and shake<br>
 slightly in the wind. Then I looked down and saw something
which<br>
 made me feel that we were far from the world in a sense and to
a<br>
 degree that I cannot easily describe. I saw that the almost<br>
 straight lines of the tall elm trees diminished a little in<br>
 perspective as they fell. I was used to seeing parallel
lines<br>
 taper towards the sky. But to see them taper towards the
earth<br>
 made me feel lost in space, like a falling star.</p>

<p>"Can nothing be done to stop Basil?" I called out.</p>

<p>"No," answered my fellow climber. "He's too far up. He must
get<br>
 to the top, and when he finds nothing but wind and leaves he
may<br>
 go sane again. Hark at him above there; you can just hear
him<br>
 talking to himself."</p>

<p>"Perhaps he's talking to us," I said.</p>

<p>"No," said Rupert, "he'd shout if he was. I've never known him
to<br>
 talk to himself before; I'm afraid he really is bad tonight;
it's<br>
 a known sign of the brain going."</p>

<p>"Yes," I said sadly, and listened. Basil's voice certainly
was<br>
 sounding above us, and not by any means in the rich and
riotous<br>
 tones in which he had hailed us before. He was speaking
quietly,<br>
 and laughing every now and then, up there among the leaves
and<br>
 stars.</p>

<p>After a silence mingled with this murmur, Rupert Grant
suddenly<br>
 said, "My God!" with a violent voice.</p>

<p>"What's the matter--are you hurt?" I cried, alarmed.</p>

<p>"No. Listen to Basil," said the other in a very strange
voice.<br>
 "He's not talking to himself."</p>

<p>"Then he is talking to us," I cried.</p>

<p>"No," said Rupert simply, "he's talking to somebody else."</p>

<p>Great branches of the elm loaded with leaves swung about us in
a<br>
 sudden burst of wind, but when it died down I could still
hear<br>
 the conversational voice above. I could hear two voices.</p>

<p>Suddenly from aloft came Basil's boisterous hailing voice
as<br>
 before: "Come up, you fellows. Here's Lieutenant Keith."</p>

<p>And a second afterwards came the half-American voice we had
heard<br>
 in our chambers more than once. It called out:</p>

<p>"Happy to see you, gentlemen; pray come in."</p>

<p>Out of a hole in an enormous dark egg-shaped thing, pendent
in<br>
 the branches like a wasps' nest, was protruding the pale face
and<br>
 fierce moustache of the lieutenant, his teeth shining with
that<br>
 slightly Southern air that belonged to him.</p>

<p>Somehow or other, stunned and speechless, we lifted
ourselves<br>
 heavily into the opening. We fell into the full glow of a
lamp-lit,<br>
 cushioned, tiny room, with a circular wall lined with books,
a<br>
 circular table, and a circular seat around it. At this table
sat<br>
 three people. One was Basil, who, in the instant after
alighting<br>
 there, had fallen into an attitude of marmoreal ease as if he
had<br>
 been there from boyhood; he was smoking a cigar with a slow<br>
 pleasure. The second was Lieutenant Drummond Keith, who
looked<br>
 happy also, but feverish and doubtful compared with his
granite<br>
 guest. The third was the little bald-headed house-agent with
the<br>
 wild whiskers, who called himself Montmorency. The spears,
the<br>
 green umbrella, and the cavalry sword hung in parallels on
the<br>
 wall. The sealed jar of strange wine was on the mantelpiece,
the<br>
 enormous rifle in the corner. In the middle of the table was
a<br>
 magnum of champagne. Glasses were already set for us.</p>

<p>The wind of the night roared far below us, like an ocean at
the<br>
 foot of a light-house. The room stirred slightly, as a cabin
might<br>
 in a mild sea.</p>

<p>Our glasses were filled, and we still sat there dazed and
dumb.<br>
 Then Basil spoke.</p>

<p>"You seem still a little doubtful, Rupert. Surely there is
no<br>
 further question about the cold veracity of our injured
host."</p>

<p>"I don't quite grasp it all," said Rupert, blinking still in
the<br>
 sudden glare. "Lieutenant Keith said his address was--"</p>

<p>"It's really quite right, sir," said Keith, with an open
smile.<br>
 "The bobby asked me where I lived. And I said, quite
truthfully,<br>
 that I lived in the elms on Buxton Common, near Purley. So I
do.<br>
 This gentleman, Mr Montmorency, whom I think you have met
before,<br>
 is an agent for houses of this kind. He has a special line
in<br>
 arboreal villas. It's being kept rather quiet at present,
because<br>
 the people who want these houses don't want them to get too
common.<br>
 But it's just the sort of thing a fellow like myself,
racketing<br>
 about in all sorts of queer corners of London, naturally knocks
up<br>
 against."</p>

<p>"Are you really an agent for arboreal villas?" asked
Rupert<br>
 eagerly, recovering his ease with the romance of reality.</p>

<p>Mr Montmorency, in his embarrassment, fingered one of his
pockets<br>
 and nervously pulled out a snake, which crawled about the
table.</p>

<p>"W-well, yes, sir," he said. "The fact was--er--my people
wanted me<br>
 very much to go into the house-agency business. But I never
cared<br>
 myself for anything but natural history and botany and things
like<br>
 that. My poor parents have been dead some years now,
but--naturally<br>
 I like to respect their wishes. And I thought somehow that
an<br>
 arboreal villa agency was a sort of--of compromise between being
a<br>
 botanist and being a house-agent."</p>

<p>Rupert could not help laughing. "Do you have much custom?" he
asked.</p>

<p>"N-not much," replied Mr Montmorency, and then he glanced
at<br>
 Keith, who was (I am convinced) his only client. "But what
there<br>
 is--very select."</p>

<p>"My dear friends," said Basil, puffing his cigar, "always
remember<br>
 two facts. The first is that though when you are guessing
about<br>
 any one who is sane, the sanest thing is the most likely; when
you<br>
 are guessing about any one who is, like our host, insane,
the<br>
 maddest thing is the most likely. The second is to remember
that<br>
 very plain literal fact always seems fantastic. If Keith had
taken<br>
 a little brick box of a house in Clapham with nothing but
railings<br>
 in front of it and had written `The Elms' over it, you
wouldn't<br>
 have thought there was anything fantastic about that. Simply<br>
 because it was a great blaring, swaggering lie you would
have<br>
 believed it."</p>

<p>"Drink your wine, gentlemen," said Keith, laughing, "for
this<br>
 confounded wind will upset it."</p>

<p>We drank, and as we did so, although the hanging house, by
a<br>
 cunning mechanism, swung only slightly, we knew that the
great<br>
 head of the elm tree swayed in the sky like a stricken
thistle.</p>

<h2>Chapter 5</h2>

<h3>The Noticeable Conduct of Professor Chadd</h3>

<p>Basil Grant had comparatively few friends besides myself; yet
he<br>
 was the reverse of an unsociable man. He would talk to any
one<br>
 anywhere, and talk not only well but with perfectly genuine
concern<br>
 and enthusiasm for that person's affairs. He went through
the<br>
 world, as it were, as if he were always on the top of an omnibus
or<br>
 waiting for a train. Most of these chance acquaintances, of
course,<br>
 vanished into darkness out of his life. A few here and there
got<br>
 hooked on to him, so to speak, and became his lifelong
intimates,<br>
 but there was an accidental look about all of them as if they
were<br>
 windfalls, samples taken at random, goods fallen from a goods
train<br>
 or presents fished out of a bran-pie. One would be, let us say,
a<br>
 veterinary surgeon with the appearance of a jockey; another, a
mild<br>
 prebendary with a white beard and vague views; another, a
young<br>
 captain in the Lancers, seemingly exactly like other captains
in<br>
 the Lancers; another, a small dentist from Fulham, in all<br>
 reasonable certainty precisely like every other dentist from<br>
 Fulham. Major Brown, small, dry, and dapper, was one of
these;<br>
 Basil had made his acquaintance over a discussion in a hotel<br>
 cloak-room about the right hat, a discussion which reduced
the<br>
 little major almost to a kind of masculine hysterics, the
compound<br>
 of the selfishness of an old bachelor and the scrupulosity of
an<br>
 old maid. They had gone home in a cab together and then dined
with<br>
 each other twice a week until they died. I myself was another.
I<br>
 had met Grant while he was still a judge, on the balcony of
the<br>
 National Liberal Club, and exchanged a few words about the
weather.<br>
 Then we had talked for about an hour about politics and God;
for<br>
 men always talk about the most important things to total
strangers.<br>
 It is because in the total stranger we perceive man himself;
the<br>
 image of God is not disguised by resemblances to an uncle or
doubts<br>
 of the wisdom of a moustache.</p>

<p><br>
 One of the most interesting of Basil's motley group of<br>
 acquaintances was Professor Chadd. He was known to the
ethnological<br>
 world (which is a very interesting world, but a long way off
this<br>
 one) as the second greatest, if not the greatest, authority on
the<br>
 relations of savages to language. He was known to the
neighbourhood<br>
 of Hart Street, Bloomsbury, as a bearded man with a bald
head,<br>
 spectacles, and a patient face, the face of an unaccountable<br>
 Nonconformist who had forgotten how to be angry. He went to and
fro<br>
 between the British Museum and a selection of blameless
tea-shops,<br>
 with an armful of books and a poor but honest umbrella. He
was<br>
 never seen without the books and the umbrella, and was supposed
(by<br>
 the lighter wits of the Persian MS. room) to go to bed with them
in<br>
 his little brick villa in the neighbourhood of Shepherd's
Bush.<br>
 There he lived with three sisters, ladies of solid goodness,
but<br>
 sinister demeanour. His life was happy, as are almost all the
lives<br>
 of methodical students, but one would not have called it<br>
 exhilarating. His only hours of exhilaration occurred when
his<br>
 friend, Basil Grant, came into the house, late at night, a
tornado<br>
 of conversation.</p>

<p>Basil, though close on sixty, had moods of boisterous
babyishness,<br>
 and these seemed for some reason or other to descend upon
him<br>
 particularly in the house of his studious and almost dingy
friend.<br>
 I can remember vividly (for I was acquainted with both parties
and<br>
 often dined with them) the gaiety of Grant on that
particular<br>
 evening when the strange calamity fell upon the professor.<br>
 Professor Chadd was, like most of his particular class and
type<br>
 (the class that is at once academic and middle-class), a
Radical<br>
 of a solemn and old-fashioned type. Grant was a Radical
himself,<br>
 but he was that more discriminating and not uncommon type of<br>
 Radical who passes most of his time in abusing the Radical
party.<br>
 Chadd had just contributed to a magazine an article called
"Zulu<br>
 Interests and the New Makango Frontier', in which a precise<br>
 scientific report of his study of the customs of the people
of<br>
 T'Chaka was reinforced by a severe protest against certain<br>
 interferences with these customs both by the British and the<br>
 Germans. He-was sitting with the magazine in front of him,
the<br>
 lamplight shining on his spectacles, a wrinkle in his
forehead,<br>
 not of anger, but of perplexity, as Basil Grant strode up and
down<br>
 the room, shaking it with his voice, with his high spirits and
his<br>
 heavy tread.</p>

<p>"It's not your opinions that I object to, my esteemed Chadd,"
he<br>
 was saying, "it's you. You are quite right to champion the
Zulus,<br>
 but for all that you do not sympathize with them. No doubt
you<br>
 know the Zulu way of cooking tomatoes and the Zulu prayer
before<br>
 blowing one's nose; but for all that you don't understand them
as<br>
 well as I do, who don't know an assegai from an alligator. You
are<br>
 more learned, Chadd, but I am more Zulu. Why is it that the
jolly<br>
 old barbarians of this earth are always championed by people
who<br>
 are their antithesis? Why is it? You are sagacious, you are<br>
 benevolent, you are well informed, but, Chadd, you are not
savage.<br>
 Live no longer under that rosy illusion. Look in the glass.
Ask<br>
 your sisters. Consult the librarian of the British Museum. Look
at<br>
 this umbrella." And he held up that sad but still
respectable<br>
 article. "Look at it. For ten mortal years to my certain
knowledge<br>
 you have carried that object under your arm, and I have no sort
of<br>
 doubt that you carried it at the age of eight months, and it
never<br>
 occurred to you to give one wild yell and hurl it like a
javelin--<br>
 thus--"</p>

<p>And he sent the umbrella whizzing past the professor's bald
head,<br>
 so that it knocked over a pile of books with a crash and left
a<br>
 vase rocking.</p>

<p>Professor Chadd appeared totally unmoved, with his face
still<br>
 lifted to the lamp and the wrinkle cut in his forehead.</p>

<p>"Your mental processes," he said, "always go a little too
fast.<br>
 And they are stated without method. There is no kind of<br>
 inconsistency"--and no words can convey the time he took to get
to<br>
 the end of the word--"between valuing the right of the
aborigines<br>
 to adhere to their stage in the evolutionary process, so long
as<br>
 they find it congenial and requisite to do so. There is, I say,
no<br>
 inconsistency between this concession which I have just
described<br>
 to you and the view that the evolutionary stage in question
is,<br>
 nevertheless, so far as we can form any estimate of values in
the<br>
 variety of cosmic processes, definable in some degree as an<br>
 inferior evolutionary stage."</p>

<p>Nothing but his lips had moved as he spoke, and his glasses
still<br>
 shone like two pallid moons.</p>

<p>Grant was shaking with laughter as he watched him.</p>

<p>"True," he said, "there is no inconsistency, my son of the
red<br>
 spear. But there is a great deal of incompatibility of temper.
I<br>
 am very far from being certain that the Zulu is on an
inferior<br>
 evolutionary stage, whatever the blazes that may mean. I do
not<br>
 think there is anything stupid or ignorant about howling at
the<br>
 moon or being afraid of devils in the dark. It seems to me<br>
 perfectly philosophical. Why should a man be thought a sort
of<br>
 idiot because he feels the mystery and peril of existence
itself?<br>
 Suppose, my dear Chadd, suppose it is we who are the idiots<br>
 because we are not afraid of devils in the dark?"</p>

<p>Professor Chadd slit open a page of the magazine with a
bone<br>
 paper-knife and the intent reverence of the bibliophile.</p>

<p>"Beyond all question," he said, "it is a tenable hypothesis.
I<br>
 allude to the hypothesis which I understand you to entertain,
that<br>
 our civilization is not or may not be an advance upon, and
indeed<br>
 (if I apprehend you), is or may be a retrogression from
states<br>
 identical with or analogous to the state of the Zulus. Moreover,
I<br>
 shall be inclined to concede that such a proposition is of
the<br>
 nature, in some degree at least, of a primary proposition,
and<br>
 cannot adequately be argued, in the same sense, I mean, that
the<br>
 primary proposition of pessimism, or the primary proposition of
the<br>
 non-existence of matter, cannot adequately be argued. But I do
not<br>
 conceive you to be under the impression that you have
demonstrated<br>
 anything more concerning this proposition than that it is
tenable,<br>
 which, after all, amounts to little more than the statement that
it<br>
 is not a contradiction in terms."</p>

<p>Basil threw a book at his head and took out a cigar.</p>

<p>"You don't understand," he said, "but, on the other hand, as
a<br>
 compensation, you don't mind smoking. Why you don't object to
that<br>
 disgustingly barbaric rite I can't think. I can only say that
I<br>
 began it when I began to be a Zulu, about the age of ten. What
I<br>
 maintained was that although you knew more about Zulus in the
sense<br>
 that you are a scientist, I know more about them in the sense
that<br>
 I am a savage. For instance, your theory of the origin of
language,<br>
 something about its having come from the formulated secret
language<br>
 of some individual creature, though you knocked me silly with
facts<br>
 and scholarship in its favour, still does not convince me,
because<br>
 I have a feeling that that is not the way that things happen.
If<br>
 you ask me why I think so I can only answer that I am a Zulu;
and<br>
 if you ask me (as you most certainly will) what is my definition
of<br>
 a Zulu, I can answer that also. He is one who has climbed a
Sussex<br>
 apple-tree at seven and been afraid of a ghost in an English
lane."</p>

<p>"Your process of thought--" began the immovable Chadd, but
his<br>
 speech was interrupted. His sister, with that masculinity
which<br>
 always in such families concentrates in sisters, flung open
the<br>
 door with a rigid arm and said:</p>

<p>"James, Mr Bingham of the British Museum wants to see you
again."</p>

<p>The philosopher rose with a dazed look, which always indicates
in<br>
 such men the fact that they regard philosophy as a familiar
thing,<br>
 but practical life as a weird and unnerving vision, and
walked<br>
 dubiously out of the room.</p>

<p>"I hope you do not mind my being aware of it, Miss Chadd,"
said<br>
 Basil Grant, "but I hear that the British Museum has
recognized<br>
 one of the men who have deserved well of their commonwealth. It
is<br>
 true, is it not, that Professor Chadd is likely to be made
keeper<br>
 of Asiatic manuscripts?"</p>

<p>The grim face of the spinster betrayed a great deal of
pleasure and<br>
 a great deal of pathos also. "I believe it's true," she said.
"If<br>
 it is, it will not only be great glory which women, I assure
you,<br>
 feel a great deal, but great relief, which they feel more;
relief<br>
 from worry from a lot of things. James' health has never been
good,<br>
 and while we are as poor as we are he had to do journalism
and<br>
 coaching, in addition to his own dreadful grinding notions
and<br>
 discoveries, which he loves more than man, woman, or child. I
have<br>
 often been afraid that unless something of this kind occurred
we<br>
 should really have to be careful of his brain. But I believe it
is<br>
 practically settled."</p>

<p>"I am delighted," began Basil, but with a worried face, "but
these<br>
 red-tape negotiations are so terribly chancy that I really
can't<br>
 advise you to build on hope, only to be hurled down into<br>
 bitterness. I've known men, and good men like your brother,
come<br>
 nearer than this and be disappointed. Of course, if it is
true--"</p>

<p>"If it is true," said the woman fiercely, "it means that
people who<br>
 have never lived may make an attempt at living."</p>

<p>Even as she spoke the professor came into the room still with
the<br>
 dazed look in his eyes.</p>

<p>"Is it true?" asked Basil, with burning eyes.</p>

<p>"Not a bit true," answered Chadd after a moment's
bewilderment.<br>
 "Your argument was in three points fallacious."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" demanded Grant.</p>

<p>"Well," said the professor slowly, "in saying that you
could<br>
 possess a knowledge of the essence of Zulu life distinct
from--"</p>

<p>"Oh! confound Zulu life," cried Grant, with a burst of
laughter. "I<br>
 mean, have you got the post?"</p>

<p>"You mean the post of keeper of the Asiatic manuscripts," he
said,<br>
 opening his eye with childlike wonder. "Oh, yes, I got that.
But<br>
 the real objection to your argument, which has only, I
admit,<br>
 occurred to me since I have been out of the room, is that it
does<br>
 not merely presuppose a Zulu truth apart from the facts, but<br>
 infers that the discovery of it is absolutely impeded by the<br>
 facts."</p>

<p>"I am crushed," said Basil, and sat down to laugh, while
the<br>
 professor's sister retired to her room, possibly, possibly
not.</p>

<p>It was extremely late when we left the Chadds, and it is
an<br>
 extremely long and tiresome journey from Shepherd's Bush to<br>
 Lambeth. This may be our excuse for the fact that we (for I
was<br>
 stopping the night with Grant) got down to breakfast next day at
a<br>
 time inexpressibly criminal, a time, in point of fact, close
upon<br>
 noon. Even to that belated meal we came in a very lounging
and<br>
 leisurely fashion. Grant, in particular, seemed so dreamy at
table<br>
 that he scarcely saw the pile of letters by his plate, and I
doubt<br>
 if he would have opened any of them if there had not lain on
the<br>
 top that one thing which has succeeded amid modern carelessness
in<br>
 being really urgent and coercive--a telegram. This he opened
with<br>
 the same heavy distraction with which he broke his egg and
drank<br>
 his tea. When he read it he did not stir a hair or say a word,
but<br>
 something, I know not what, made me feel that the motionless
figure<br>
 had been pulled together suddenly as strings are tightened on
a<br>
 slack guitar. Though he said nothing and did not move, I knew
that<br>
 he had been for an instant cleared and sharpened with a shock
of<br>
 cold water. It was scarcely any surprise to me when a man who
had<br>
 drifted sullenly to his seat and fallen into it, kicked it
away<br>
 like a cur from under him and came round to me in two
strides.</p>

<p>"What do you make of that?" he said, and flattened out the
wire<br>
 in front of me.</p>

<p>It ran: "Please come at once. James' mental state
dangerous.<br>
 Chadd."</p>

<p>"What does the woman mean?" I said after a pause,
irritably.<br>
 "Those women have been saying that the poor old professor was
mad<br>
 ever since he was born."</p>

<p>"You are mistaken," said Grant composedly. "It is true that
all<br>
 sensible women think all studious men mad. It is true, for
the<br>
 matter of that, all women of any kind think all men of any
kind<br>
 mad. But they don't put it in telegrams, any more than they
wire<br>
 to you that grass is green or God all-merciful. These things
are<br>
 truisms, and often private ones at that. If Miss Chadd has
written<br>
 down under the eye of a strange woman in a post-office that
her<br>
 brother is off his head you may be perfectly certain that she
did<br>
 it because it was a matter of life and death, and she can think
of<br>
 no other way of forcing us to come promptly."</p>

<p>"It will force us of course," I said, smiling.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes," he replied; "there is a cab-rank near."</p>

<p>Basil scarcely said a word as we drove across Westminster
Bridge,<br>
 through Trafalgar Square, along Piccadilly, and up the
Uxbridge<br>
 Road. Only as he was opening the gate he spoke.</p>

<p>"I think you will take my word for it, my friend," he said;
"this<br>
 is one of the most queer and complicated and astounding
incidents<br>
 that ever happened in London or, for that matter, in any
high<br>
 civilization."</p>

<p>"I confess with the greatest sympathy and reverence that I
don't<br>
 quite see it," I said. "Is it so very extraordinary or
complicated<br>
 that a dreamy somnambulant old invalid who has always walked
on<br>
 the borders of the inconceivable should go mad under the shock
of<br>
 great joy? Is it so very extraordinary that a man with a head
like<br>
 a turnip and a soul like a spider's web should not find his<br>
 strength equal to a confounding change of fortunes? Is it,
in<br>
 short, so very extraordinary that James Chadd should lose his
wits<br>
 from excitement?"</p>

<p><br>
 "It would not be extraordinary in the least," answered
Basil,<br>
 with placidity. "It would not be extraordinary in the least,"
he<br>
 repeated, "if the professor had gone mad. That was not the<br>
 extraordinary circumstance to which I referred."</p>

<p>"What," I asked, stamping my foot, "was the extraordinary
thing?"</p>

<p>"The extraordinary thing," said Basil, ringing the bell, "is
that<br>
 he has not gone mad from excitement."</p>

<p>The tall and angular figure of the eldest Miss Chadd blocked
the<br>
 doorway as the door opened. Two other Miss Chadds seemed in
the<br>
 same way to be blocking the narrow passage and the little
parlour.<br>
 There was a general sense of their keeping something from
view.<br>
 They seemed like three black-clad ladies in some strange play
of<br>
 Maeterlinck, veiling the catastrophe from the audience in
the<br>
 manner of the Greek chorus.</p>

<p>"Sit down, won't you?" said one of them, in a voice that
was<br>
 somewhat rigid with pain. "I think you had better be told
first<br>
 what has happened."</p>

<p>Then, with her bleak face looking unmeaningly out of the
window,<br>
 she continued, in an even and mechanical voice:</p>

<p>"I had better state everything that occurred just as it
occurred.<br>
 This morning I was clearing away the breakfast things, my
sisters<br>
 were both somewhat unwell, and had not come down. My brother
had<br>
 just gone out of the room, I believe, to fetch a book. He came
back<br>
 again, however, without it, and stood for some time staring at
the<br>
 empty grate. I said, `Were you looking for anything I could
get?'<br>
 He did not answer, but this constantly happens, as he is often
very<br>
 abstracted. I repeated my question, and still he did not
answer.<br>
 Sometimes he is so wrapped up in his studies that nothing but
a<br>
 touch on the shoulder would make him aware of one's presence, so
I<br>
 came round the table towards him. I really do not know how
to<br>
 describe the sensation which I then had. It seems simply silly,
but<br>
 at the moment it seemed something enormous, upsetting one's
brain.<br>
 The fact is, James was standing on one leg."</p>

<p>Grant smiled slowly and rubbed his hands with a kind of
care.</p>

<p>"Standing on one leg?" I repeated.</p>

<p>"Yes," replied the dead voice of the woman without an
inflection to<br>
 suggest that she felt the fantasticality of her statement. "He
was<br>
 standing on the left leg and the right drawn up at a sharp
angle,<br>
 the toe pointing downwards. I asked him if his leg hurt him.
His<br>
 only answer was to shoot the leg straight at right angles to
the<br>
 other, as if pointing to the other with his toe to the wall. He
was<br>
 still looking quite gravely at the fireplace.</p>

<p>"`James, what is the matter?' I cried, for I was
thoroughly<br>
 frightened. James gave three kicks in the air with the right
leg,<br>
 flung up the other, gave three kicks in the air with it also
and<br>
 spun round like a teetotum the other way. `Are you mad?' I
cried.<br>
 `Why don't you answer me?' He had come to a standstill facing
me,<br>
 and was looking at me as he always does, with his lifted
eyebrows<br>
 and great spectacled eyes. When I had spoken he remained a
second<br>
 or two motionless, and then his only reply was to lift his
left<br>
 foot slowly from the floor and describe circles with it in the
air.<br>
 I rushed to the door and shouted for Christina. I will not dwell
on<br>
 the dreadful hours that followed. All three of us talked to
him,<br>
 implored him to speak to us with appeals that might have
brought<br>
 back the dead, but he has done nothing but hop and dance and
kick<br>
 with a solemn silent face. It looks as if his legs belonged to
some<br>
 one else or were possessed by devils. He has never spoken to
us<br>
 from that time to this."</p>

<p>"Where is he now?" I said, getting up in some agitation. "We
ought<br>
 not to leave him alone."</p>

<p>"Doctor Colman is with him," said Miss Chadd calmly. "They are
in<br>
 the garden. Doctor Colman thought the air would do him good. And
he<br>
 can scarcely go into the street."</p>

<p>Basil and I walked rapidly to the window which looked out on
the<br>
 garden. It was a small and somewhat smug suburban garden;
the<br>
 flower beds a little too neat and like the pattern of a
coloured<br>
 carpet; but on this shining and opulent summer day even they
had<br>
 the exuberance of something natural, I had almost said
tropical.<br>
 In the middle of a bright and verdant but painfully circular
lawn<br>
 stood two figures. One of them was a small, sharp-looking man
with<br>
 black whiskers and a very polished hat (I presume Dr Colman),
who<br>
 was talking very quietly and clearly, yet with a nervous twitch,
as<br>
 it were, in his face. The other was our old friend, listening
with<br>
 his old forbearing expression and owlish eyes, the strong
sunlight<br>
 gleaming on his glasses as the lamplight had gleamed the
night<br>
 before, when the boisterous Basil had rallied him on his
studious<br>
 decorum. But for one thing the figure of this morning might
have<br>
 been the identical figure of last night. That one thing was
that<br>
 while the face listened reposefully the legs were
industriously<br>
 dancing like the legs of a marionette. The neat flowers and
the<br>
 sunny glitter of the garden lent an indescribable sharpness
and<br>
 incredibility to the prodigy--the prodigy of the head of a
hermit<br>
 and the legs of a harlequin. For miracles should always happen
in<br>
 broad daylight. The night makes them credible and therefore<br>
 commonplace.</p>

<p>The second sister had by this time entered the room and
came<br>
 somewhat drearily to the window.</p>

<p>"You know, Adelaide," she said, "that Mr Bingham from the
Museum is<br>
 coming again at three."</p>

<p>"I know," said Adelaide Chadd bitterly. "I suppose we shall
have to<br>
 tell him about this. I thought that no good fortune would ever
come<br>
 easily to us."</p>

<p>Grant suddenly turned round. "What do you mean?" he said.
"What<br>
 will you have to tell Mr Bingham?"</p>

<p>"You know what I shall have to tell him," said the
professor's<br>
 sister, almost fiercely. "I don't know that we need give it
its<br>
 wretched name. Do you think that the keeper of Asiatic
manuscripts<br>
 will be allowed to go on like that?" And she pointed for an<br>
 instant at the figure in the garden, the shining, listening
face<br>
 and the unresting feet.</p>

<p>Basil Grant took out his watch with an abrupt movement. "When
did<br>
 you say the British Museum man was coming?" he said.</p>

<p>"Three o'clock," said Miss Chadd briefly.</p>

<p>"Then I have an hour before me," said Grant, and without
another<br>
 word threw up the window and jumped out into the garden. He
did<br>
 not walk straight up to the doctor and lunatic, but
strolling<br>
 round the garden path drew near them cautiously and yet
apparently<br>
 carelessly. He stood a couple of feet off them, seemingly
counting<br>
 halfpence out of his trousers pocket, but, as I could see,
looking<br>
 up steadily under the broad brim of his hat.</p>

<p>Suddenly he stepped up to Professor Chadd's elbow, and said,
in a<br>
 loud familiar voice, "Well, my boy, do you still think the
Zulus<br>
 our inferiors?"</p>

<p>The doctor knitted his brows and looked anxious, seeming to
be<br>
 about to speak. The professor turned his bald and placid
head<br>
 towards Grant in a friendly manner, but made no answer, idly<br>
 flinging his left leg about.</p>

<p>"Have you converted Dr Colman to your views?" Basil
continued,<br>
 still in the same loud and lucid tone.</p>

<p>Chadd only shuffled his feet and kicked a little with the
other<br>
 leg, his expression still benevolent and inquiring. The doctor
cut<br>
 in rather sharply. "Shall we go inside, professor?" he said.
"Now<br>
 you have shown me the garden. A beautiful garden. A most
beautiful<br>
 garden. Let us go in," and he tried to draw the kicking<br>
 ethnologist by the elbow, at the same time whispering to Grant:
"I<br>
 must ask you not to trouble him with questions. Most risky.
He<br>
 must be soothed."</p>

<p>Basil answered in the same tone, with great coolness:</p>

<p>"Of course your directions must be followed out, doctor. I
will<br>
 endeavour to do so, but I hope it will not be inconsistent
with<br>
 them if you will leave me alone with my poor friend in this
garden<br>
 for an hour. I want to watch him. I assure you, Dr Colman, that
I<br>
 shall say very little to him, and that little shall be as
soothing<br>
 as--as syrup."</p>

<p>The doctor wiped his eyeglass thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"It is rather dangerous for him," he said, "to be long in
the<br>
 strong sun without his hat. With his bald head, too."</p>

<p>"That is soon settled," said Basil composedly, and took off
his<br>
 own big hat and clapped it on the egglike skull of the
professor.<br>
 The latter did not turn round but danced away with his eyes on
the<br>
 horizon.</p>

<p>The doctor put on his glasses again, looked severely at the
two<br>
 for some seconds, with his head on one side like a bird's,
and<br>
 then saying, shortly, "All right," strutted away into the
house,<br>
 where the three Misses Chadd were all looking out from the
parlour<br>
 window on to the garden. They looked out on it with hungry
eyes<br>
 for a full hour without moving, and they saw a sight which
was<br>
 more extraordinary than madness itself.</p>

<p>Basil Grant addressed a few questions to the madman,
without<br>
 succeeding in making him do anything but continue to caper,
and<br>
 when he had done this slowly took a red note-book out of one<br>
 pocket and a large pencil out of another.</p>

<p>He began hurriedly to scribble notes. When the lunatic
skipped<br>
 away from him he would walk a few yards in pursuit, stop,
and<br>
 make notes again. Thus they followed each other round and
round<br>
 the foolish circle of turf, the one writing in pencil with
the<br>
 face of a man working out a problem, the other leaping and<br>
 playing like a child.</p>

<p>After about three-quarters of an hour of this imbecile
scene,<br>
 Grant put the pencil in his pocket, but kept the note-book
open<br>
 in his hand, and walking round the mad professor, planted
himself<br>
 directly in front of him.</p>

<p>Then occurred something that even those already used to that
wild<br>
 morning had not anticipated or dreamed. The professor, on
finding<br>
 Basil in front of him, stared with a blank benignity for a
few<br>
 seconds, and then drew up his left leg and hung it bent in
the<br>
 attitude that his sister had described as being the first of
all<br>
 his antics. And the moment he had done it Basil Grant lifted
his<br>
 own leg and held it out rigid before him, confronting Chadd
with<br>
 the flat sole of his boot. The professor dropped his bent
leg,<br>
 and swinging his weight on to it kicked out the other
behind,<br>
 like a man swimming. Basil crossed his feet like a saltire
cross,<br>
 and then flung them apart again, giving a leap into the air.
Then<br>
 before any of the spectators could say a word or even entertain
a<br>
 thought about the matter, both of them were dancing a sort of
jig<br>
 or hornpipe opposite each other; and the sun shone down on
two<br>
 madmen instead of one.</p>

<p>They were so stricken with the deafness and blindness of<br>
 monomania that they did not see the eldest Miss Chadd come
out<br>
 feverishly into the garden with gestures of entreaty, a
gentleman<br>
 following her. Professor Chadd was in the wildest posture of
a<br>
 pas-de-quatre, Basil Grant seemed about to turn a
cart-wheel,<br>
 when they were frozen in their follies by the steely voice
of<br>
 Adelaide Chadd saying, "Mr Bingham of the British Museum."</p>

<p>Mr Bingham was a slim, well-clad gentleman with a pointed
and<br>
 slightly effeminate grey beard, unimpeachable gloves, and
formal<br>
 but agreeable manners. He was the type of the over-civilized,
as<br>
 Professor Chadd was of the uncivilized pedant. His formality
and<br>
 agreeableness did him some credit under the circumstances. He
had<br>
 a vast experience of books and a considerable experience of
the<br>
 more dilettante fashionable salons. But neither branch of<br>
 knowledge had accustomed him to the spectacle of two
grey-haired<br>
 middle-class gentlemen in modern costume throwing themselves<br>
 about like acrobats as a substitute for an after-dinner nap.</p>

<p>The professor continued his antics with perfect placidity,
but<br>
 Grant stopped abruptly. The doctor had reappeared on the
scene,<br>
 and his shiny black eyes, under his shiny black hat, moved<br>
 restlessly from one of them to the other.</p>

<p>"Dr Colman," said Basil, turning to him, "will you
entertain<br>
 Professor Chadd again for a little while? I am sure that he
needs<br>
 you. Mr Bingham, might I have the pleasure of a few moments'<br>
 private conversation? My name is Grant."</p>

<p>Mr Bingham, of the British Museum, bowed in a manner that
was<br>
 respectful but a trifle bewildered.</p>

<p>"Miss Chadd will excuse me," continued Basil easily, "if I
know<br>
 my way about the house." And he led the dazed librarian
rapidly<br>
 through the back door into the parlour.</p>

<p>"Mr Bingham," said Basil, setting a chair for him, "I imagine
that<br>
 Miss Chadd has told you of this distressing occurrence."</p>

<p>"She has, Mr Grant," said Bingham, looking at the table with a
sort<br>
 of compassionate nervousness. "I am more pained than I can say
by<br>
 this dreadful calamity. It seems quite heart-rending that the
thing<br>
 should have happened just as we have decided to give your
eminent<br>
 friend a position which falls far short of his merits. As it is,
of<br>
 course--really, I don't know what to say. Professor Chadd may,
of<br>
 course, retain--I sincerely trust he will--his
extraordinarily<br>
 valuable intellect. But I am afraid--I am really afraid--that
it<br>
 would not do to have the curator of the Asiatic<br>
 manuscripts--er--dancing about."</p>

<p>"I have a suggestion to make," said Basil, and sat down
abruptly in<br>
 his chair, drawing it up to the table.</p>

<p>"I am delighted, of course," said the gentleman from the
British<br>
 Museum, coughing and drawing up his chair also.</p>

<p>The clock on the mantelpiece ticked for just the moments
required<br>
 for Basil to clear his throat and collect his words, and then
he<br>
 said:</p>

<p>"My proposal is this. I do not know that in the strict use of
words<br>
 you could altogether call it a compromise, still it has
something<br>
 of that character. My proposal is that the Government (acting,
as I<br>
 presume, through your Museum) should pay Professor Chadd L800
a<br>
 year until he stops dancing."</p>

<p>"Eight hundred a year!" said Mr Bingham, and for the first
time<br>
 lifted his mild blue eyes to those of his interlocutor--and
he<br>
 raised them with a mild blue stare. "I think I have not
quite<br>
 understood you. Did I understand you to say that Professor
Chadd<br>
 ought to be employed, in his present state, in the Asiatic<br>
 manuscript department at eight hundred a year?"</p>

<p>Grant shook his head resolutely.</p>

<p>"No," he said firmly. "No. Chadd is a friend of mine, and I
would<br>
 say anything for him I could. But I do not say, I cannot say,
that<br>
 he ought to take on the Asiatic manuscripts. I do not go so far
as<br>
 that. I merely say that until he stops dancing you ought to
pay<br>
 him L800 Surely you have some general fund for the endowment
of<br>
 research."</p>

<p>Mr Bingham looked bewildered.</p>

<p>"I really don't know," he said, blinking his eyes, "what you
are<br>
 talking about. Do you ask us to give this obvious lunatic nearly
a<br>
 thousand a year for life?"</p>

<p>"Not at all," cried Basil, keenly and triumphantly. "I never
said<br>
 for life. Not at all."</p>

<p>"What for, then?" asked the meek Bingham, suppressing an
instinct<br>
 meekly to tear his hair. "How long is this endowment to run?
Not<br>
 till his death? Till the Judgement day?"</p>

<p>"No," said Basil, beaming, "but just what I said. Till he
has<br>
 stopped dancing." And he lay back with satisfaction and his
hands<br>
 in his pockets.</p>

<p>Bingham had by this time fastened his eyes keenly on Basil
Grant<br>
 and kept them there.</p>

<p>"Come, Mr Grant," he said. "Do I seriously understand you
to<br>
 suggest that the Government pay Professor Chadd an
extraordinarily<br>
 high salary simply on the ground that he has (pardon the
phrase)<br>
 gone mad? That he should be paid more than four good clerks
solely<br>
 on the ground that he is flinging his boots about in the
back<br>
 yard?"</p>

<p>"Precisely," said Grant composedly.</p>

<p>"That this absurd payment is not only to run on with the
absurd<br>
 dancing, but actually to stop with the absurd dancing?"</p>

<p>"One must stop somewhere," said Grant. "Of course."</p>

<p>Bingham rose and took up his perfect stick and gloves.</p>

<p>"There is really nothing more to be said, Mr Grant," he
said<br>
 coldly. "What you are trying to explain to me may be a
joke--a<br>
 slightly unfeeling joke. It may be your sincere view, in which
case<br>
 I ask your pardon for the former suggestion. But, in any case,
it<br>
 appears quite irrelevant to my duties. The mental morbidity,
the<br>
 mental downfall, of Professor Chadd, is a thing so painful to
me<br>
 that I cannot easily endure to speak of it. But it is clear
there<br>
 is a limit to everything. And if the Archangel Gabriel went mad
it<br>
 would sever his connection, I am sorry to say, with the
British<br>
 Museum Library."</p>

<p>He was stepping towards the door, but Grant's hand, flung out
in<br>
 dramatic warning, arrested him.</p>

<p>"Stop!" said Basil sternly. "Stop while there is yet time. Do
you<br>
 want to take part in a great work, Mr Bingham? Do you want to
help<br>
 in the glory of Europe--in the glory of science? Do you want
to<br>
 carry your head in the air when it is bald or white because of
the<br>
 part that you bore in a great discovery? Do you want--"</p>

<p>Bingham cut in sharply:</p>

<p>"And if I do want this, Mr Grant--"</p>

<p>"Then," said Basil lightly, "your task is easy. Get Chadd L800
a<br>
 year till he stops dancing."</p>

<p>With a fierce flap of his swinging gloves Bingham turned<br>
 impatiently to the door, but in passing out of it found it<br>
 blocked. Dr Colman was coming in.</p>

<p>"Forgive me, gentlemen," he said, in a nervous, confidential
voice,<br>
 "the fact is, Mr Grant, I--er--have made a most disturbing<br>
 discovery about Mr Chadd."</p>

<p>Bingham looked at him with grave eyes.</p>

<p>"I was afraid so," he said. "Drink, I imagine."</p>

<p>"Drink!" echoed Colman, as if that were a much milder affair.
"Oh,<br>
 no, it's not drink."</p>

<p>Mr Bingham became somewhat agitated, and his voice grew
hurried and<br>
 vague. "Homicidal mania--" he began.</p>

<p>"No, no," said the medical man impatiently.</p>

<p>"Thinks he's made of glass," said Bingham feverishly, "or says
he's<br>
 God--or--"</p>

<p>"No," said Dr Colman sharply; "the fact is, Mr Grant, my
discovery<br>
 is of a different character. The awful thing about him is--"</p>

<p>"Oh, go on, sir," cried Bingham, in agony.</p>

<p>"The awful thing about him is," repeated Colman, with
deliberation,<br>
 "that he isn't mad."</p>

<p>"Not mad!"</p>

<p>"There are quite well-known physical tests of lunacy," said
the<br>
 doctor shortly; "he hasn't got any of them."</p>

<p>"But why does he dance?" cried the despairing Bingham. "Why
doesn't<br>
 he answer us? Why hasn't he spoken to his family?"</p>

<p>"The devil knows," said Dr Colman coolly. "I'm paid to judge
of<br>
 lunatics, but not of fools. The man's not mad."</p>

<p>"What on earth can it mean? Can't we make him listen?" said
Mr<br>
 Bingham. "Can none get into any kind of communication with
him?"</p>

<p>Grant's voice struck in sudden and clear, like a steel
bell:</p>

<p>"I shall be very happy," he said, "to give him any message you
like<br>
 to send."</p>

<p>Both men stared at him.</p>

<p>"Give him a message?" they cried simultaneously. "How will you
give<br>
 him a message?"</p>

<p>Basil smiled in his slow way.</p>

<p>"If you really want to know how I shall give him your
message," he<br>
 began, but Bingham cried:</p>

<p>"Of course, of course," with a sort of frenzy.</p>

<p>"Well," said Basil, "like this." And he suddenly sprang a
foot<br>
 into the air, coming down with crashing boots, and then stood
on<br>
 one leg.</p>

<p>His face was stern, though this effect was slightly spoiled by
the<br>
 fact that one of his feet was making wild circles in the
air.</p>

<p>"You drive me to it," he said. "You drive me to betray my
friend.<br>
 And I will, for his own sake, betray him."</p>

<p>The sensitive face of Bingham took on an extra expression
of<br>
 distress as of one anticipating some disgraceful disclosure.<br>
 "Anything painful, of course--" he began.</p>

<p>Basil let his loose foot fall on the carpet with a crash
that<br>
 struck them all rigid in their feeble attitudes.</p>

<p>"Idiots!" he cried. "Have you seen the man? Have you looked
at<br>
 James Chadd going dismally to and fro from his dingy house
to<br>
 your miserable library, with his futile books and his
confounded<br>
 umbrella, and never seen that he has the eyes of a fanatic?
Have<br>
 you never noticed, stuck casually behind his spectacles and
above<br>
 his seedy old collar, the face of a man who might have
burned<br>
 heretics, or died for the philosopher's stone? It is all my<br>
 fault, in a way: I lit the dynamite of his deadly faith. I
argued<br>
 against him on the score of his famous theory about
language--the<br>
 theory that language was complete in certain individuals and
was<br>
 picked up by others simply by watching them. I also chaffed
him<br>
 about not understanding things in rough and ready practice.
What<br>
 has this glorious bigot done? He has answered me. He has
worked<br>
 out a system of language of his own (it would take too long
to<br>
 explain); he has made up, I say, a language of his own. And
he<br>
 has sworn that till people understand it, till he can speak to
us<br>
 in this language, he will not speak in any other. And he
shall<br>
 not. I have understood, by taking careful notice; and, by
heaven,<br>
 so shall the others. This shall not be blown upon. He shall<br>
 finish his experiment. He shall have L800 a year from
somewhere<br>
 till he has stopped dancing. To stop him now is an infamous
war<br>
 on a great idea. It is religious persecution."</p>

<p><br>
 Mr Bingham held out his hand cordially.</p>

<p>"I thank you, Mr Grant," he said. "I hope I shall be able to
answer<br>
 for the source of the L800 and I fancy that I shall. Will you
come<br>
 in my cab?"</p>

<p>"No, thank you very much, Mr Bingham," said Grant heartily.
"I<br>
 think I will go and have a chat with the professor in the
garden."</p>

<p>The conversation between Chadd and Grant appeared to be
personal<br>
 and friendly. They were still dancing when I left.</p>

<h2>Chapter 6</h2>

<h3>The Eccentric Seclusion of the Old Lady</h3>

<p>The conversation of Rupert Grant had two great elements of<br>
 interest--first, the long fantasias of detective deduction
in<br>
 which he was engaged, and, second, his genuine romantic
interest<br>
 in the life of London. His brother Basil said of him: "His<br>
 reasoning is particularly cold and clear, and invariably
leads<br>
 him wrong. But his poetry comes in abruptly and leads him
right."<br>
 Whether this was true of Rupert as a whole, or no, it was<br>
 certainly curiously supported by one story about him which I<br>
 think worth telling.</p>

<p><br>
 We were walking along a lonely terrace in Brompton together.
The<br>
 street was full of that bright blue twilight which comes
about<br>
 half past eight in summer, and which seems for the moment to
be<br>
 not so much a coming of darkness as the turning on of a new
azure<br>
 illuminator, as if the earth were lit suddenly by a sapphire
sun.<br>
 In the cool blue the lemon tint of the lamps had already begun
to<br>
 flame, and as Rupert and I passed them, Rupert talking
excitedly,<br>
 one after another the pale sparks sprang out of the dusk.
Rupert<br>
 was talking excitedly because he was trying to prove to me
the<br>
 nine hundred and ninety-ninth of his amateur detective
theories.<br>
 He would go about London, with this mad logic in his brain,
seeing<br>
 a conspiracy in a cab accident, and a special providence in
a<br>
 falling fusee. His suspicions at the moment were fixed upon
an<br>
 unhappy milkman who walked in front of us. So arresting were
the<br>
 incidents which afterwards overtook us that I am really
afraid<br>
 that I have forgotten what were the main outlines of the
milkman's<br>
 crime. I think it had something to do with the fact that he
had<br>
 only one small can of milk to carry, and that of that he had
left<br>
 the lid loose and walked so quickly that he spilled milk on
the<br>
 pavement. This showed that he was not thinking of his small<br>
 burden, and this again showed that he anticipated some other
than<br>
 lacteal business at the end of his walk, and this (taken in<br>
 conjunction with something about muddy boots) showed
something<br>
 else that I have entirely forgotten. I am afraid that I
derided<br>
 this detailed revelation unmercifully; and I am afraid that
Rupert<br>
 Grant, who, though the best of fellows, had a good deal of
the<br>
 sensitiveness of the artistic temperament, slightly resented
my<br>
 derision. He endeavoured to take a whiff of his cigar, with
the<br>
 placidity which he associated with his profession, but the
cigar,<br>
 I think, was nearly bitten through.</p>

<p>"My dear fellow," he said acidly, "I'll bet you half a crown
that<br>
 wherever that milkman comes to a real stop I'll find out
something<br>
 curious."</p>

<p>"My resources are equal to that risk," I said, laughing.
"Done."</p>

<p>We walked on for about a quarter of an hour in silence in
the<br>
 trail of the mysterious milkman. He walked quicker and
quicker,<br>
 and we had some ado to keep up with him; and every now and then
he<br>
 left a splash of milk, silver in the lamplight. Suddenly,
almost<br>
 before we could note it, he disappeared down the area steps of
a<br>
 house. I believe Rupert really believed that the milkman was
a<br>
 fairy; for a second he seemed to accept him as having
vanished.<br>
 Then calling something to me which somehow took no hold on
my<br>
 mind, he darted after the mystic milkman, and disappeared
himself<br>
 into the area.</p>

<p>I waited for at least five minutes, leaning against a
lamp-post<br>
 in the lonely street. Then the milkman came swinging up the
steps<br>
 without his can and hurried off clattering down the road. Two
or<br>
 three minutes more elapsed, and then Rupert came bounding up<br>
 also, his face pale but yet laughing; a not uncommon<br>
 contradiction in him, denoting excitement.</p>

<p>"My friend," he said, rubbing his hands, "so much for all
your<br>
 scepticism. So much for your philistine ignorance of the<br>
 possibilities of a romantic city. Two and sixpence, my boy,
is<br>
 the form in which your prosaic good nature will have to
express<br>
 itself."</p>

<p>"What?" I said incredulously, "do you mean to say that you
really<br>
 did find anything the matter with the poor milkman?"</p>

<p>His face fell.</p>

<p>"Oh, the milkman," he said, with a miserable affectation at
having<br>
 misunderstood me. "No, I--I--didn't exactly bring anything home
to<br>
 the milkman himself, I--"</p>

<p>"What did the milkman say and do?" I said, with inexorable<br>
 sternness.</p>

<p>"Well, to tell the truth," said Rupert, shifting restlessly
from<br>
 one foot to another, "the milkman himself, as far as merely<br>
 physical appearances went, just said, `Milk, Miss,' and handed
in<br>
 the can. That is not to say, of course, that he did not make
some<br>
 secret sign or some--"</p>

<p>I broke into a violent laugh. "You idiot," I said, "why don't
you<br>
 own yourself wrong and have done with it? Why should he have
made<br>
 a secret sign any more than any one else? You own he said
nothing<br>
 and did nothing worth mentioning. You own that, don't you?"</p>

<p>His face grew grave.</p>

<p>"Well, since you ask me, I must admit that I do. It is
possible<br>
 that the milkman did not betray himself. It is even possible
that<br>
 I was wrong about him."</p>

<p>"Then come along with you," I said, with a certain amicable
anger,<br>
 "and remember that you owe me half a crown."</p>

<p>"As to that, I differ from you," said Rupert coolly. "The<br>
 milkman's remarks may have been quite innocent. Even the
milkman<br>
 may have been. But I do not owe you half a crown. For the terms
of<br>
 the bet were, I think, as follows, as I propounded them,
that<br>
 wherever that milkman came to a real stop I should find out<br>
 something curious."</p>

<p>"Well?" I said.</p>

<p>"Well," he answered, "I jolly well have. You just come with
me,"<br>
 and before I could speak he had turned tail once more and
whisked<br>
 through the blue dark into the moat or basement of the house.
I<br>
 followed almost before I made any decision.</p>

<p>When we got down into the area I felt indescribably
foolish<br>
 literally, as the saying is, in a hole. There was nothing but
a<br>
 closed door, shuttered windows, the steps down which we had
come,<br>
 the ridiculous well in which I found myself, and the
ridiculous<br>
 man who had brought me there, and who stood there with
dancing<br>
 eyes. I was just about to turn back when Rupert caught me by
the<br>
 elbow.</p>

<p>"Just listen to that," he said, and keeping my coat gripped in
his<br>
 right hand, he rapped with the knuckles of his left on the
shutters<br>
 of the basement window. His air was so definite that I paused
and<br>
 even inclined my head for a moment towards it. From inside
was<br>
 coming the murmur of an unmistakable human voice.</p>

<p>"Have you been talking to somebody inside?" I asked
suddenly,<br>
 turning to Rupert.</p>

<p>"No, I haven't," he replied, with a grim smile, "but I should
very<br>
 much like to. Do you know what somebody is saying in there?"</p>

<p>"No, of course not," I replied.</p>

<p>"Then I recommend you to listen," said Rupert sharply.</p>

<p>In the dead silence of the aristocratic street at evening, I
stood<br>
 a moment and listened. From behind the wooden partition, in
which<br>
 there was a long lean crack, was coming a continuous and
moaning<br>
 sound which took the form of the words: "When shall I get out?
When<br>
 shall I get out? Will they ever let me out?" or words to
that<br>
 effect.</p>

<p>"Do you know anything about this?" I said, turning upon Rupert
very<br>
 abruptly.</p>

<p>"Perhaps you think I am the criminal," he said
sardonically,<br>
 "instead of being in some small sense the detective. I came
into<br>
 this area two or three minutes ago, having told you that I
knew<br>
 there was something funny going on, and this woman behind
the<br>
 shutters (for it evidently is a woman) was moaning like mad.
No,<br>
 my dear friend, beyond that I do not know anything about her.
She<br>
 is not, startling as it may seem, my disinherited daughter, or
a<br>
 member of my secret seraglio. But when I hear a human being
wailing<br>
 that she can't get out, and talking to herself like a mad woman
and<br>
 beating on the shutters with her fists, as she was doing two
or<br>
 three minutes ago, I think it worth mentioning, that is
all."</p>

<p>"My dear fellow," I said, "I apologize; this is no time
for<br>
 arguing. What is to be done?"</p>

<p>Rupert Grant had a long clasp-knife naked and brilliant in his
hand.</p>

<p>"First of all," he said, "house-breaking." And he forced the
blade<br>
 into the crevice of the wood and broke away a huge splinter,<br>
 leaving a gap and glimpse of the dark window-pane inside. The
room<br>
 within was entirely unlighted, so that for the first few
seconds<br>
 the window seemed a dead and opaque surface, as dark as a strip
of<br>
 slate. Then came a realization which, though in a sense
gradual,<br>
 made us step back and catch our breath. Two large dim human
eyes<br>
 were so close to us that the window itself seemed suddenly to be
a<br>
 mask. A pale human face was pressed against the glass within,
and<br>
 with increased distinctness, with the increase of the opening
came<br>
 the words:</p>

<p>"When shall I get out?"</p>

<p>"What can all this be?" I said.</p>

<p>Rupert made no answer, but lifting his walking-stick and
pointing<br>
 the ferrule like a fencing sword at the glass, punched a hole
in<br>
 it, smaller and more accurate than I should have supposed
possible.<br>
 The moment he had done so the voice spouted out of the hole, so
to<br>
 speak, piercing and querulous and clear, making the same demand
for<br>
 liberty.</p>

<p>"Can't you get out, madam?" I said, drawing near the hole in
some<br>
 perturbation.</p>

<p>"Get out? Of course I can't," moaned the unknown female
bitterly.<br>
 "They won't let me. I told them I would be let out. I told
them<br>
 I'd call the police. But it's no good. Nobody knows, nobody
comes.<br>
 They could keep me as long as they liked only--"</p>

<p>I was in the very act of breaking the window finally with
my<br>
 stick, incensed with this very sinister mystery, when Rupert
held<br>
 my arm hard, held it with a curious, still, and secret rigidity
as<br>
 if he desired to stop me, but did not desire to be observed to
do<br>
 so. I paused a moment, and in the act swung slightly round,
so<br>
 that I was facing the supporting wall of the front door steps.
The<br>
 act froze me into a sudden stillness like that of Rupert, for
a<br>
 figure almost as motionless as the pillars of the portico,
but<br>
 unmistakably human, had put his head out from between the<br>
 doorposts and was gazing down into the area. One of the
lighted<br>
 lamps of the street was just behind his head, throwing it
into<br>
 abrupt darkness. Consequently, nothing whatever could be seen
of<br>
 his face beyond one fact, that he was unquestionably staring
at<br>
 us. I must say I thought Rupert's calmness magnificent. He
rang<br>
 the area bell quite idly, and went on talking to me with the
easy<br>
 end of a conversation which had never had any beginning. The
black<br>
 glaring figure in the portico did not stir. I almost thought
it<br>
 was really a statue. In another moment the grey area was
golden<br>
 with gaslight as the basement door was opened suddenly and a
small<br>
 and decorous housemaid stood in it.</p>

<p>"Pray excuse me," said Rupert, in a voice which he contrived
to<br>
 make somehow or other at once affable and underbred, "but we<br>
 thought perhaps that you might do something for the Waifs
and<br>
 Strays. We don't expect--"</p>

<p>"Not here," said the small servant, with the incomparable
severity<br>
 of the menial of the non-philanthropic, and slammed the door
in<br>
 our faces.</p>

<p>"Very sad, very sad--the indifference of these people," said
the<br>
 philanthropist with gravity, as we went together up the steps.
As<br>
 we did so the motionless figure in the portico suddenly<br>
 disappeared.</p>

<p>"Well, what do you make of that?" asked Rupert, slapping
his<br>
 gloves together when we got into the street.</p>

<p>I do not mind admitting that I was seriously upset. Under
such<br>
 conditions I had but one thought.</p>

<p>"Don't you think," I said a trifle timidly, "that we had
better<br>
 tell your brother?"</p>

<p>"Oh, if you like," said Rupert, in a lordly way. "He is
quite<br>
 near, as I promised to meet him at Gloucester Road Station.
Shall<br>
 we take a cab? Perhaps, as you say, it might amuse him."</p>

<p>Gloucester Road Station had, as if by accident, a somewhat<br>
 deserted look. After a little looking about we discovered
Basil<br>
 Grant with his great head and his great white hat blocking
the<br>
 ticket-office window. I thought at first that he was taking
a<br>
 ticket for somewhere and being an astonishingly long time
about<br>
 it. As a matter of fact, he was discussing religion with the<br>
 booking-office clerk, and had almost got his head through the
hole<br>
 in his excitement. When we dragged him away it was some time<br>
 before he would talk of anything but the growth of an
Oriental<br>
 fatalism in modern thought, which had been well typified by
some<br>
 of the official's ingenious but perverse fallacies. At last
we<br>
 managed to get him to understand that we had made an
astounding<br>
 discovery. When he did listen, he listened attentively,
walking<br>
 between us up and down the lamp-lit street, while we told him in
a<br>
 rather feverish duet of the great house in South Kensington,
of<br>
 the equivocal milkman, of the lady imprisoned in the basement,
and<br>
 the man staring from the porch. At length he said:</p>

<p><br>
 "If you're thinking of going back to look the thing up, you must
be<br>
 careful what you do. It's no good you two going there. To go
twice<br>
 on the same pretext would look dubious. To go on a different<br>
 pretext would look worse. You may be quite certain that the<br>
 inquisitive gentleman who looked at you looked thoroughly, and
will<br>
 wear, so to speak, your portraits next to his heart. If you want
to<br>
 find out if there is anything in this without a police raid I
fancy<br>
 you had better wait outside. I'll go in and see them."</p>

<p>His slow and reflective walk brought us at length within sight
of<br>
 the house. It stood up ponderous and purple against the last
pallor<br>
 of twilight. It looked like an ogre's castle. And so apparently
it<br>
 was.</p>

<p>"Do you think it's safe, Basil," said his brother, pausing,
a<br>
 little pale, under the lamp, "to go into that place alone?
Of<br>
 course we shall be near enough to hear if you yell, but
these<br>
 devils might do something--something sudden--or odd. I can't
feel<br>
 it's safe."</p>

<p>"I know of nothing that is safe," said Basil composedly,
"except,<br>
 possibly--death," and he went up the steps and rang at the
bell.<br>
 When the massive respectable door opened for an instant, cutting
a<br>
 square of gaslight in the gathering dark, and then closed with
a<br>
 bang, burying our friend inside, we could not repress a
shudder.<br>
 It had been like the heavy gaping and closing of the dim lips
of<br>
 some evil leviathan. A freshening night breeze began to blow
up<br>
 the street, and we turned up the collars of our coats. At the
end<br>
 of twenty minutes, in which we had scarcely moved or spoken,
we<br>
 were as cold as icebergs, but more, I think, from
apprehension<br>
 than the atmosphere. Suddenly Rupert made an abrupt movement<br>
 towards the house.</p>

<p>"I can't stand this," he began, but almost as he spoke sprang
back<br>
 into the shadow, for the panel of gold was again cut out of
the<br>
 black house front, and the burly figure of Basil was
silhouetted<br>
 against it coming out. He was roaring with laughter and talking
so<br>
 loudly that you could have heard every syllable across the
street.<br>
 Another voice, or, possibly, two voices, were laughing and
talking<br>
 back at him from within.</p>

<p>"No, no, no," Basil was calling out, with a sort of
hilarious<br>
 hostility. "That's quite wrong. That's the most ghastly heresy
of<br>
 all. It's the soul, my dear chap, the soul that's the arbiter
of<br>
 cosmic forces. When you see a cosmic force you don't like,
trick<br>
 it, my boy. But I must really be off."</p>

<p>"Come and pitch into us again," came the laughing voice from
out<br>
 of the house. "We still have some bones unbroken."</p>

<p>"Thanks very much, I will--good night," shouted Grant, who had
by<br>
 this time reached the street.</p>

<p>"Good night," came the friendly call in reply, before the
door<br>
 closed.</p>

<p>"Basil," said Rupert Grant, in a hoarse whisper, "what are we
to<br>
 do?"</p>

<p>The elder brother looked thoughtfully from one of us to the
other.</p>

<p>"What is to be done, Basil?" I repeated in uncontrollable<br>
 excitement.</p>

<p>"I'm not sure," said Basil doubtfully. "What do you say to
getting<br>
 some dinner somewhere and going to the Court Theatre tonight?
I<br>
 tried to get those fellows to come, but they couldn't."</p>

<p>We stared blankly.</p>

<p>"Go to the Court Theatre?" repeated Rupert. "What would be the
good<br>
 of that?"</p>

<p>"Good? What do you mean?" answered Basil, staring also. "Have
you<br>
 turned Puritan or Passive Resister, or something? For fun,
of<br>
 course."</p>

<p>"But, great God in Heaven! What are we going to do, I mean!"
cried<br>
 Rupert. "What about the poor woman locked up in that house?
Shall I<br>
 go for the police?"</p>

<p>Basil's face cleared with immediate comprehension, and he
laughed.</p>

<p>"Oh, that," he said. "I'd forgotten that. That's all right.
Some<br>
 mistake, possibly. Or some quite trifling private affair. But
I'm<br>
 sorry those fellows couldn't come with us. Shall we take one
of<br>
 these green omnibuses? There is a restaurant in Sloane
Square."</p>

<p>"I sometimes think you play the fool to frighten us," I
said<br>
 irritably. "How can we leave that woman locked up? How can it be
a<br>
 mere private affair? How can crime and kidnapping and murder,
for<br>
 all I know, be private affairs? If you found a corpse in a
man's<br>
 drawing-room, would you think it bad taste to talk about it
just<br>
 as if it was a confounded dado or an infernal etching?"</p>

<p>Basil laughed heartily.</p>

<p>"That's very forcible," he said. "As a matter of fact, though,
I<br>
 know it's all right in this case. And there comes the green<br>
 omnibus."</p>

<p>"How do you know it's all right in this ease?" persisted
his<br>
 brother angrily.</p>

<p>"My dear chap, the thing's obvious," answered Basil, holding
a<br>
 return ticket between his teeth while he fumbled in his
waistcoat<br>
 pocket. "Those two fellows never committed a crime in their
lives.<br>
 They're not the kind. Have either of you chaps got a halfpenny?
I<br>
 want to get a paper before the omnibus comes."</p>

<p>"Oh, curse the paper!" cried Rupert, in a fury. "Do you mean
to<br>
 tell me, Basil Grant, that you are going to leave a fellow<br>
 creature in pitch darkness in a private dungeon, because
you've<br>
 had ten minutes' talk with the keepers of it and thought
them<br>
 rather good men?"</p>

<p>"Good men do commit crimes sometimes," said Basil, taking
the<br>
 ticket out of his mouth. "But this kind of good man doesn't<br>
 commit that kind of crime. Well, shall we get on this
omnibus?"</p>

<p>The great green vehicle was indeed plunging and lumbering
along<br>
 the dim wide street towards us. Basil had stepped from the
curb,<br>
 and for an instant it was touch and go whether we should all
have<br>
 leaped on to it and been borne away to the restaurant and
the<br>
 theatre.</p>

<p>"Basil," I said, taking him firmly by the shoulder, "I
simply<br>
 won't leave this street and this house."</p>

<p>"Nor will I," said Rupert, glaring at it and biting his
fingers.<br>
 "There's some black work going on there. If I left it I
should<br>
 never sleep again."</p>

<p>Basil Grant looked at us both seriously.</p>

<p>"Of course if you feel like that," he said, "we'll
investigate<br>
 further. You'll find it's all right, though. They're only
two<br>
 young Oxford fellows. Extremely nice, too, though rather
infected<br>
 with this pseudo-Darwinian business. Ethics of evolution and
all<br>
 that."</p>

<p>"I think," said Rupert darkly, ringing the bell, "that we
shall<br>
 enlighten you further about their ethics."</p>

<p>"And may I ask," said Basil gloomily, "what it is that you
propose<br>
 to do?"</p>

<p>"I propose, first of all," said Rupert, "to get into this
house;<br>
 secondly, to have a look at these nice young Oxford men;
thirdly,<br>
 to knock them down, bind them, gag them, and search the
house."</p>

<p>Basil stared indignantly for a few minutes. Then he was shaken
for<br>
 an instant with one of his sudden laughs.</p>

<p>"Poor little boys," he said. "But it almost serves them right
for<br>
 holding such silly views, after all," and he quaked again
with<br>
 amusement "there's something confoundedly Darwinian about
it."</p>

<p>"I suppose you mean to help us?" said Rupert.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, I'll be in it," answered Basil, "if it's only to
prevent<br>
 your doing the poor chaps any harm."</p>

<p>He was standing in the rear of our little procession,
looking<br>
 indifferent and sometimes even sulky, but somehow the instant
the<br>
 door opened he stepped first into the hall, glowing with
urbanity.</p>

<p>"So sorry to haunt you like this," he said. "I met two
friends<br>
 outside who very much want to know you. May I bring them
in?"</p>

<p>"Delighted, of course," said a young voice, the unmistakable
voice<br>
 of the Isis, and I realized that the door had been opened, not
by<br>
 the decorous little servant girl, but by one of our hosts in<br>
 person. He was a short, but shapely young gentleman, with
curly<br>
 dark hair and a square, snub-nosed face. He wore slippers and
a<br>
 sort of blazer of some incredible college purple.</p>

<p>"This way," he said; "mind the steps by the staircase. This
house<br>
 is more crooked and old-fashioned than you would think from
its<br>
 snobbish exterior. There are quite a lot of odd corners in
the<br>
 place really."</p>

<p>"That," said Rupert, with a savage smile, "I can quite
believe."</p>

<p>We were by this time in the study or back parlour, used by
the<br>
 young inhabitants as a sitting-room, an apartment littered
with<br>
 magazines and books ranging from Dante to detective stories.
The<br>
 other youth, who stood with his back to the fire smoking a
corncob,<br>
 was big and burly, with dead brown hair brushed forward and
a<br>
 Norfolk jacket. He was that particular type of man whose
every<br>
 feature and action is heavy and clumsy, and yet who is, you
would<br>
 say, rather exceptionally a gentleman.</p>

<p>"Any more arguments?" he said, when introductions had been<br>
 effected. "I must say, Mr Grant, you were rather severe upon<br>
 eminent men of science such as we. I've half a mind to chuck<br>
 my D.Sc. and turn minor poet."</p>

<p>"Bosh," answered Grant. "I never said a word against eminent
men<br>
 of science. What I complain of is a vague popular philosophy
which<br>
 supposes itself to be scientific when it is really nothing but
a<br>
 sort of new religion and an uncommonly nasty one. When
people<br>
 talked about the fall of man they knew they were talking about
a<br>
 mystery, a thing they didn't understand. Now that they talk
about<br>
 the survival of the fittest they think they do understand
it,<br>
 whereas they have not merely no notion, they have an
elaborately<br>
 false notion of what the words mean. The Darwinian movement
has<br>
 made no difference to mankind, except that, instead of
talking<br>
 unphilosophically about philosophy, they now talk
unscientifically<br>
 about science."</p>

<p>"That is all very well," said the big young man, whose
name<br>
 appeared to be Burrows. "Of course, in a sense, science,
like<br>
 mathematics or the violin, can only be perfectly understood
by<br>
 specialists. Still, the rudiments may be of public use.
Greenwood<br>
 here," indicating the little man in the blazer, "doesn't know
one<br>
 note of music from another. Still, he knows something. He
knows<br>
 enough to take off his hat when they play `God save the King'.
He<br>
 doesn't take it off by mistake when they play `Oh, dem
Golden<br>
 Slippers'. Just in the same way science--"</p>

<p>Here Mr Burrows stopped abruptly. He was interrupted by an
argument<br>
 uncommon in philosophical controversy and perhaps not wholly<br>
 legitimate. Rupert Grant had bounded on him from behind, flung
an<br>
 arm round his throat, and bent the giant backwards.</p>

<p>"Knock the other fellow down, Swinburne," he called out, and
before<br>
 I knew where I was I was locked in a grapple with the man in
the<br>
 purple blazer. He was a wiry fighter, who bent and sprang like
a<br>
 whalebone, but I was heavier and had taken him utterly by
surprise.<br>
 I twitched one of his feet from under him; he swung for a moment
on<br>
 the single foot, and then we fell with a crash amid the litter
of<br>
 newspapers, myself on top.</p>

<p>My attention for a moment released by victory, I could hear
Basil's<br>
 voice finishing some long sentence of which I had not heard
the<br>
 beginning.</p>

<p>". . . wholly, I must confess, unintelligible to me, my dear
sir,<br>
 and I need not say unpleasant. Still one must side with one's
old<br>
 friends against the most fascinating new ones. Permit me,<br>
 therefore, in tying you up in this antimacassar, to make it
as<br>
 commodious as handcuffs can reasonably be while. . ."</p>

<p>I had staggered to my feet. The gigantic Burrows was toiling
in the<br>
 garotte of Rupert, while Basil was striving to master his
mighty<br>
 hands. Rupert and Basil were both particularly strong, but so
was<br>
 Mr Burrows; how strong, we knew a second afterwards. His head
was<br>
 held back by Rupert's arm, but a convulsive heave went over
his<br>
 whole frame. An instant after his head plunged forward like
a<br>
 bull's, and Rupert Grant was slung head over heels, a
catherine<br>
 wheel of legs, on the floor in front of him. Simultaneously
the<br>
 bull's head butted Basil in the chest, bringing him also to
the<br>
 ground with a crash, and the monster, with a Berserker roar,
leaped<br>
 at me and knocked me into the corner of the room, smashing
the<br>
 waste-paper basket. The bewildered Greenwood sprang furiously
to<br>
 his feet. Basil did the same. But they had the best of it
now.</p>

<p>Greenwood dashed to the bell and pulled it violently, sending
peals<br>
 through the great house. Before I could get panting to my feet,
and<br>
 before Rupert, who had been literally stunned for a few
moments,<br>
 could even lift his head from the floor, two footmen were in
the<br>
 room. Defeated even when we were in a majority, we were now<br>
 outnumbered. Greenwood and one of the footmen flung themselves
upon<br>
 me, crushing me back into the corner upon the wreck of the
paper<br>
 basket. The other two flew at Basil, and pinned him against
the<br>
 wall. Rupert lifted himself on his elbow, but he was still
dazed.</p>

<p>In the strained silence of our helplessness I heard the voice
of<br>
 Basil come with a loud incongruous cheerfulness.</p>

<p>"Now this," he said, "is what I call enjoying oneself."</p>

<p>I caught a glimpse of his face, flushed and forced against
the<br>
 bookcase, from between the swaying limbs of my captors and his.
To<br>
 my astonishment his eyes were really brilliant with pleasure,
like<br>
 those of a child heated by a favourite game.</p>

<p>I made several apoplectic efforts to rise, but the servant was
on<br>
 top of me so heavily that Greenwood could afford to leave me
to<br>
 him. He turned quickly to come to reinforce the two who were<br>
 mastering Basil. The latter's head was already sinking lower
and<br>
 lower, like a leaking ship, as his enemies pressed him down.
He<br>
 flung up one hand just as I thought him falling and hung on to
a<br>
 huge tome in the bookcase, a volume, I afterwards discovered,
of<br>
 St Chrysostom's theology. Just as Greenwood bounded across
the<br>
 room towards the group, Basil plucked the ponderous tome
bodily<br>
 out of the shelf, swung it, and sent it spinning through the
air,<br>
 so that it struck Greenwood flat in the face and knocked him
over<br>
 like a rolling ninepin. At the same instant Basil's
stiffness<br>
 broke, and he sank, his enemies closing over him.</p>

<p>Rupert's head was clear, but his body shaken; he was hanging
as<br>
 best he could on to the half-prostrate Greenwood. They were
rolling<br>
 over each other on the floor, both somewhat enfeebled by
their<br>
 falls, but Rupert certainly the more so. I was still
successfully<br>
 held down. The floor was a sea of torn and trampled papers
and<br>
 magazines, like an immense waste-paper basket. Burrows and
his<br>
 companion were almost up to the knees in them, as in a drift
of<br>
 dead leaves. And Greenwood had his leg stuck right through a
sheet<br>
 of the Pall Mall Gazette, which clung to it ludicrously, like
some<br>
 fantastic trouser frill.</p>

<p><br>
 Basil, shut from me in a human prison, a prison of powerful
bodies,<br>
 might be dead for all I knew. I fancied, however, that the
broad<br>
 back of Mr Burrows, which was turned towards me, had a certain
bend<br>
 of effort in it as if my friend still needed some holding
down.<br>
 Suddenly that broad back swayed hither and thither. It was
swaying<br>
 on one leg; Basil, somehow, had hold of the other. Burrows'
huge<br>
 fists and those of the footman were battering Basil's sunken
head<br>
 like an anvil, but nothing could get the giant's ankle out of
his<br>
 sudden and savage grip. While his own head was forced slowly
down<br>
 in darkness and great pain, the right leg of his captor was
being<br>
 forced in the air. Burrows swung to and fro with a purple
face.<br>
 Then suddenly the floor and the walls and the ceiling shook<br>
 together, as the colossus fell, all his length seeming to fill
the<br>
 floor. Basil sprang up with dancing eyes, and with three blows
like<br>
 battering-rams knocked the footman into a cocked hat. Then
he<br>
 sprang on top of Burrows, with one antimacassar in his hand
and<br>
 another in his teeth, and bound him hand and foot almost before
he<br>
 knew clearly that his head had struck the floor. Then Basil
sprang<br>
 at Greenwood, whom Rupert was struggling to hold down, and
between<br>
 them they secured him easily. The man who had hold of me let go
and<br>
 turned to his rescue, but I leaped up like a spring released,
and,<br>
 to my infinite satisfaction, knocked the fellow down. The
other<br>
 footman, bleeding at the mouth and quite demoralized, was
stumbling<br>
 out of the room. My late captor, without a word, slunk after
him,<br>
 seeing that the battle was won. Rupert was sitting astride
the<br>
 pinioned Mr Greenwood, Basil astride the pinioned Mr
Burrows.</p>

<p>To my surprise the latter gentleman, lying bound on his back,
spoke<br>
 in a perfectly calm voice to the man who sat on top of him.</p>

<p>"And now, gentlemen," he said, "since you have got your own
way,<br>
 perhaps you wouldn't mind telling us what the deuce all this
is?"</p>

<p>"This," said Basil, with a radiant face, looking down at
his<br>
 captive, "this is what we call the survival of the fittest."</p>

<p>Rupert, who had been steadily collecting himself throughout
the<br>
 latter phases of the fight, was intellectually altogether
himself<br>
 again at the end of it. Springing up from the prostrate
Greenwood,<br>
 and knotting a handkerchief round his left hand, which was
bleeding<br>
 from a blow, he sang out quite coolly:</p>

<p>"Basil, will you mount guard over the captive of your bow and
spear<br>
 and antimacassar? Swinburne and I will clear out the prison<br>
 downstairs."</p>

<p>"All right," said Basil, rising also and seating himself in
a<br>
 leisured way in an armchair. "Don't hurry for us," he said,<br>
 glancing round at the litter of the room, "we have all the<br>
 illustrated papers."</p>

<p>Rupert lurched thoughtfully out of the room, and I followed
him<br>
 even more slowly; in fact, I lingered long enough to hear, as
I<br>
 passed through the room, the passages and the kitchen
stairs,<br>
 Basil's voice continuing conversationally:</p>

<p>"And now, Mr Burrows," he said, settling himself sociably in
the<br>
 chair, "there's no reason why we shouldn't go on with that
amusing<br>
 argument. I'm sorry that you have to express yourself lying on
your<br>
 back on the floor, and, as I told you before, I've no more
notion<br>
 why you are there than the man in the moon. A
conversationalist<br>
 like yourself, however, can scarcely be seriously handicapped
by<br>
 any bodily posture. You were saying, if I remember right, when
this<br>
 incidental fracas occurred, that the rudiments of science
might<br>
 with advantage be made public."</p>

<p>"Precisely," said the large man on the floor in an easy tone.
"I<br>
 hold that nothing more than a rough sketch of the universe as
seen<br>
 by science can be. . ."</p>

<p>And here the voices died away as we descended into the
basement. I<br>
 noticed that Mr Greenwood did not join in the amicable
controversy.<br>
 Strange as it may appear, I think he looked back upon our<br>
 proceedings with a slight degree of resentment. Mr Burrows,<br>
 however, was all philosophy and chattiness. We left them, as I
say,<br>
 together, and sank deeper and deeper into the under-world of
that<br>
 mysterious house, which, perhaps, appeared to us somewhat
more<br>
 Tartarean than it really was, owing to our knowledge of its<br>
 semi-criminal mystery and of the human secret locked below.</p>

<p>The basement floor had several doors, as is usual in such a
house;<br>
 doors that would naturally lead to the kitchen, the scullery,
the<br>
 pantry, the servants' hall, and so on. Rupert flung open all
the<br>
 doors with indescribable rapidity. Four out of the five opened
on<br>
 entirely empty apartments. The fifth was locked. Rupert broke
the<br>
 door in like a bandbox, and we fell into the sudden blackness
of<br>
 the sealed, unlighted room.</p>

<p>Rupert stood on the threshold, and called out like a man
calling<br>
 into an abyss:</p>

<p>"Whoever you are, come out. You are free. The people who held
you<br>
 captive are captives themselves. We heard you crying and we came
to<br>
 deliver you. We have bound your enemies upstairs hand and foot.
You<br>
 are free."</p>

<p>For some seconds after he had spoken into the darkness there
was<br>
 a dead silence in it. Then there came a kind of muttering
and<br>
 moaning. We might easily have taken it for the wind or rats if
we<br>
 had not happened to have heard it before. It was unmistakably
the<br>
 voice of the imprisoned woman, drearily demanding liberty, just
as<br>
 we had heard her demand it.</p>

<p>"Has anybody got a match?" said Rupert grimly. "I fancy we
have<br>
 come pretty near the end of this business."</p>

<p>I struck a match and held it up. It revealed a large,
bare,<br>
 yellow-papered apartment with a dark-clad figure at the other
end<br>
 of it near the window. An instant after it burned my fingers
and<br>
 dropped, leaving darkness. It had, however, revealed
something<br>
 more practical--an iron gas bracket just above my head. I
struck<br>
 another match and lit the gas. And we found ourselves suddenly
and<br>
 seriously in the presence of the captive.</p>

<p>At a sort of workbox in the window of this subterranean<br>
 breakfast-room sat an elderly lady with a singularly high
colour<br>
 and almost startling silver hair. She had, as if designedly
to<br>
 relieve these effects, a pair of Mephistophelian black
eyebrows<br>
 and a very neat black dress. The glare of the gas lit up her<br>
 piquant hair and face perfectly against the brown background
of<br>
 the shutters. The background was blue and not brown in one
place;<br>
 at the place where Rupert's knife had torn a great opening in
the<br>
 wood about an hour before.</p>

<p>"Madam," said he, advancing with a gesture of the hat, "permit
me<br>
 to have the pleasure of announcing to you that you are free.
Your<br>
 complaints happened to strike our ears as we passed down the<br>
 street, and we have therefore ventured to come to your
rescue."</p>

<p>The old lady with the red face and the black eyebrows looked
at us<br>
 for a moment with something of the apoplectic stare of a
parrot.<br>
 Then she said, with a sudden gust or breathing of relief:</p>

<p>"Rescue? Where is Mr Greenwood? Where is Mr Burrows? Did you
say<br>
 you had rescued me?"</p>

<p>"Yes, madam," said Rupert, with a beaming condescension. "We
have<br>
 very satisfactorily dealt with Mr Greenwood and Mr Burrows. We
have<br>
 settled affairs with them very satisfactorily."</p>

<p>The old lady rose from her chair and came very quickly towards
us.</p>

<p>"What did you say to them? How did you persuade them?" she
cried.</p>

<p>"We persuaded them, my dear madam," said Rupert, laughing,
"by<br>
 knocking them down and tying them up. But what is the
matter?"</p>

<p>To the surprise of every one the old lady walked slowly back
to<br>
 her seat by the window.</p>

<p>"Do I understand," she said, with the air of a person about
to<br>
 begin knitting, "that you have knocked down Mr Burrows and
tied<br>
 him up?"</p>

<p>"We have," said Rupert proudly; "we have resisted their
oppression<br>
 and conquered it."</p>

<p>"Oh, thanks," answered the old lady, and sat down by the
window.</p>

<p>A considerable pause followed.</p>

<p>"The road is quite clear for you, madam," said Rupert
pleasantly.</p>

<p>The old lady rose, cocking her black eyebrows and her silver
crest<br>
 at us for an instant.</p>

<p>"But what about Greenwood and Burrows?" she said. "What did
I<br>
 understand you to say had become of them?"</p>

<p>"They are lying on the floor upstairs," said Rupert,
chuckling.<br>
 "Tied hand and foot."</p>

<p>"Well, that settles it," said the old lady, coming with a kind
of<br>
 bang into her seat again, "I must stop where I am."</p>

<p>Rupert looked bewildered.</p>

<p>"Stop where you are?" he said. "Why should you stop any
longer<br>
 where you are? What power can force you now to stop in this<br>
 miserable cell?"</p>

<p>"The question rather is," said the old lady, with composure,
"what<br>
 power can force me to go anywhere else?"</p>

<p>We both stared wildly at her and she stared tranquilly at us
both.</p>

<p>At last I said, "Do you really mean to say that we are to
leave<br>
 you here?"</p>

<p>"I suppose you don't intend to tie me up," she said, "and
carry me<br>
 off? I certainly shall not go otherwise."</p>

<p>"But, my dear madam," cried out Rupert, in a radiant
exasperation,<br>
 "we heard you with our own ears crying because you could not
get<br>
 out."</p>

<p>"Eavesdroppers often hear rather misleading things," replied
the<br>
 captive grimly. "I suppose I did break down a bit and lose
my<br>
 temper and talk to myself. But I have some sense of honour for
all<br>
 that."</p>

<p>"Some sense of honour?" repeated Rupert, and the last light
of<br>
 intelligence died out of his face, leaving it the face of an
idiot<br>
 with rolling eyes.</p>

<p>He moved vaguely towards the door and I followed. But I turned
yet<br>
 once more in the toils of my conscience and curiosity. "Can we
do<br>
 nothing for you, madam?" I said forlornly.</p>

<p>"Why," said the lady, "if you are particularly anxious to do
me a<br>
 little favour you might untie the gentlemen upstairs."</p>

<p>Rupert plunged heavily up the kitchen staircase, shaking it
with<br>
 his vague violence. With mouth open to speak he stumbled to
the<br>
 door of the sitting-room and scene of battle.</p>

<p>"Theoretically speaking, that is no doubt true," Mr Burrows
was<br>
 saying, lying on his back and arguing easily with Basil; "but
we<br>
 must consider the matter as it appears to our sense. The
origin<br>
 of morality. . ."</p>

<p>"Basil," cried Rupert, gasping, "she won't come out."</p>

<p>"Who won't come out?" asked Basil, a little cross at being<br>
 interrupted in an argument.</p>

<p>"The lady downstairs," replied Rupert. "The lady who was
locked up.<br>
 She won't come out. And she says that all she wants is for us
to<br>
 let these fellows loose."</p>

<p>"And a jolly sensible suggestion," cried Basil, and with a
bound he<br>
 was on top of the prostrate Burrows once more and was
unknotting<br>
 his bonds with hands and teeth.</p>

<p>"A brilliant idea. Swinburne, just undo Mr Greenwood."</p>

<p>In a dazed and automatic way I released the little gentleman
in the<br>
 purple jacket, who did not seem to regard any of the proceedings
as<br>
 particularly sensible or brilliant. The gigantic Burrows, on
the<br>
 other hand, was heaving with herculean laughter.</p>

<p>"Well," said Basil, in his cheeriest way, "I think we must
be<br>
 getting away. We've so much enjoyed our evening. Far too
much<br>
 regard for you to stand on ceremony. If I may so express
myself,<br>
 we've made ourselves at home. Good night. Thanks so much.
Come<br>
 along, Rupert."</p>

<p>"Basil," said Rupert desperately, "for God's sake come and see
what<br>
 you can make of the woman downstairs. I can't get the
discomfort<br>
 out of my mind. I admit that things look as if we had made a<br>
 mistake. But these gentlemen won't mind perhaps. . ."</p>

<p>"No, no," cried Burrows, with a sort of Rabelaisian
uproariousness.<br>
 "No, no, look in the pantry, gentlemen. Examine the coal-hole.
Make<br>
 a tour of the chimneys. There are corpses all over the house,
I<br>
 assure you."</p>

<p><br>
 This adventure of ours was destined to differ in one respect
from<br>
 others which I have narrated. I had been through many wild
days<br>
 with Basil Grant, days for the first half of which the sun and
the<br>
 moon seemed to have gone mad. But it had almost invariably
happened<br>
 that towards the end of the day and its adventure things had<br>
 cleared themselves like the sky after rain, and a luminous
and<br>
 quiet meaning had gradually dawned upon me. But this day's work
was<br>
 destined to end in confusion worse confounded. Before we left
that<br>
 house, ten minutes afterwards, one half-witted touch was
added<br>
 which rolled all our minds in cloud. If Rupert's head had
suddenly<br>
 fallen off on the floor, if wings had begun to sprout out of<br>
 Greenwood's shoulders, we could scarcely have been more
suddenly<br>
 stricken. And yet of this we had no explanation. We had to go
to<br>
 bed that night with the prodigy and get up next morning with it
and<br>
 let it stand in our memories for weeks and months. As will be
seen,<br>
 it was not until months afterwards that by another accident and
in<br>
 another way it was explained. For the present I only state
what<br>
 happened.</p>

<p>When all five of us went down the kitchen stairs again,
Rupert<br>
 leading, the two hosts bringing up the rear, we found the door
of<br>
 the prison again closed. Throwing it open we found the place
again<br>
 as black as pitch. The old lady, if she was still there, had
turned<br>
 out the gas: she seemed to have a weird preference for sitting
in<br>
 the dark.</p>

<p>Without another word Rupert lit the gas again. The little old
lady<br>
 turned her bird-like head as we all stumbled forward in the
strong<br>
 gaslight. Then, with a quickness that almost made me jump,
she<br>
 sprang up and swept a sort of old-fashioned curtsey or
reverence. I<br>
 looked quickly at Greenwood and Burrows, to whom it was natural
to<br>
 suppose this subservience had been offered. I felt irritated
at<br>
 what was implied in this subservience, and desired to see the
faces<br>
 of the tyrants as they received it. To my surprise they did
not<br>
 seem to have seen it at all: Burrows was paring his nails with
a<br>
 small penknife. Greenwood was at the back of the group and
had<br>
 hardly entered the room. And then an amazing fact became
apparent.<br>
 It was Basil Grant who stood foremost of the group, the
golden<br>
 gaslight lighting up his strong face and figure. His face wore
an<br>
 expression indescribably conscious, with the suspicion of a
very<br>
 grave smile. His head was slightly bent with a restrained bow.
It<br>
 was he who had acknowledged the lady's obeisance. And it was
he,<br>
 beyond any shadow of reasonable doubt, to whom it had really
been<br>
 directed.</p>

<p>"So I hear," he said, in a kindly yet somehow formal voice,
"I<br>
 hear, madam, that my friends have been trying to rescue you.
But<br>
 without success."</p>

<p>"No one, naturally, knows my faults better than you," answered
the<br>
 lady with a high colour. "But you have not found me guilty
of<br>
 treachery."</p>

<p>"I willingly attest it, madam," replied Basil, in the same
level<br>
 tones, "and the fact is that I am so much gratified with
your<br>
 exhibition of loyalty that I permit myself the pleasure of<br>
 exercising some very large discretionary powers. You would
not<br>
 leave this room at the request of these gentlemen. But you
know<br>
 that you can safely leave it at mine."</p>

<p>The captive made another reverence. "I have never complained
of<br>
 your injustice," she said. "I need scarcely say what I think
of<br>
 your generosity."</p>

<p>And before our staring eyes could blink she had passed out of
the<br>
 room, Basil holding the door open for her.</p>

<p>He turned to Greenwood with a relapse into joviality. "This
will<br>
 be a relief to you," he said.</p>

<p>"Yes, it will," replied that immovable young gentleman with a
face<br>
 like a sphinx.</p>

<p>We found ourselves outside in the dark blue night, shaken and
dazed<br>
 as if we had fallen into it from some high tower.</p>

<p>"Basil," said Rupert at last, in a weak voice, "I always
thought<br>
 you were my brother. But are you a man? I mean--are you only
a<br>
 man?"</p>

<p>"At present," replied Basil, "my mere humanity is proved by
one<br>
 of the most unmistakable symbols--hunger. We are too late
for<br>
 the theatre in Sloane Square. But we are not too late for
the<br>
 restaurant. Here comes the green omnibus!" and he had leaped
on<br>
 it before we could speak.</p>

<p>
------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

<p>As I said, it was months after that Rupert Grant suddenly
entered<br>
 my room, swinging a satchel in his hand and with a general air
of<br>
 having jumped over the garden wall, and implored me to go with
him<br>
 upon the latest and wildest of his expeditions. He proposed
to<br>
 himself no less a thing than the discovery of the actual
origin,<br>
 whereabouts, and headquarters of the source of all our joys
and<br>
 sorrows--the Club of Queer Trades. I should expand this story
for<br>
 ever if I explained how ultimately we ran this strange entity
to<br>
 its lair. The process meant a hundred interesting things.
The<br>
 tracking of a member, the bribing of a cabman, the fighting
of<br>
 roughs, the lifting of a paving stone, the finding of a
cellar,<br>
 the finding of a cellar below the cellar, the finding of the<br>
 subterranean passage, the finding of the Club of Queer
Trades.</p>

<p>I have had many strange experiences in my life, but never
a<br>
 stranger one than that I felt when I came out of those
rambling,<br>
 sightless, and seemingly hopeless passages into the sudden<br>
 splendour of a sumptuous and hospitable dining-room,
surrounded<br>
 upon almost every side by faces that I knew. There was Mr<br>
 Montmorency, the Arboreal House-Agent, seated between the two
brisk<br>
 young men who were occasionally vicars, and always
Professional<br>
 Detainers. There was Mr P. G. Northover, founder of the
Adventure<br>
 and Romance Agency. There was Professor Chadd, who invented
the<br>
 dancing Language.</p>

<p>As we entered, all the members seemed to sink suddenly into
their<br>
 chairs, and with the very action the vacancy of the
presidential<br>
 seat gaped at us like a missing tooth.</p>

<p>"The president's not here," said Mr P. G. Northover,
turning<br>
 suddenly to Professor Chadd.</p>

<p>"N--no," said the philosopher, with more than his ordinary<br>
 vagueness. "I can't imagine where he is."</p>

<p>"Good heavens," said Mr Montmorency, jumping up, "I really
feel a<br>
 little nervous. I'll go and see." And he ran out of the
room.</p>

<p>An instant after he ran back again, twittering with a
timid<br>
 ecstasy.</p>

<p>"He's there, gentlemen--he's there all right--he's coming in
now,"<br>
 he cried, and sat down. Rupert and I could hardly help feeling
the<br>
 beginnings of a sort of wonder as to who this person might be
who<br>
 was the first member of this insane brotherhood. Who, we
thought<br>
 indistinctly, could be maddest in this world of madmen: what<br>
 fantastic was it whose shadow filled all these fantastics with
so<br>
 loyal an expectation?</p>

<p>Suddenly we were answered. The door flew open and the room
was<br>
 filled and shaken with a shout, in the midst of which Basil
Grant,<br>
 smiling and in evening dress, took his seat at the head of
the<br>
 table.</p>

<p>How we ate that dinner I have no idea. In the common way I am
a<br>
 person particularly prone to enjoy the long luxuriance of the
club<br>
 dinner. But on this occasion it seemed a hopeless and
endless<br>
 string of courses. Hors-d'oeuvre sardines seemed as big as<br>
 herrings, soup seemed a sort of ocean, larks were ducks,
ducks<br>
 were ostriches until that dinner was over. The cheese course
was<br>
 maddening. I had often heard of the moon being made of green<br>
 cheese. That night I thought the green cheese was made of
the<br>
 moon. And all the time Basil Grant went on laughing and eating
and<br>
 drinking, and never threw one glance at us to tell us why he
was<br>
 there, the king of these capering idiots.</p>

<p>At last came the moment which I knew must in some way
enlighten us,<br>
 the time of the club speeches and the club toasts. Basil Grant
rose<br>
 to his feet amid a surge of songs and cheers.</p>

<p>"Gentlemen," he said, "it is a custom in this society that
the<br>
 president for the year opens the proceedings not by any
general<br>
 toast of sentiment, but by calling upon each member to give a
brief<br>
 account of his trade. We then drink to that calling and to all
who<br>
 follow it. It is my business, as the senior member, to open
by<br>
 stating my claim to membership of this club. Years ago,
gentlemen,<br>
 I was a judge; I did my best in that capacity to do justice and
to<br>
 administer the law. But it gradually dawned on me that in my
work,<br>
 as it was, I was not touching even the fringe of justice. I
was<br>
 seated in the seat of the mighty, I was robed in scarlet and<br>
 ermine; nevertheless, I held a small and lowly and futile post.
I<br>
 had to go by a mean rule as much as a postman, and my red and
gold<br>
 was worth no more than his. Daily there passed before me taut
and<br>
 passionate problems, the stringency of which I had to pretend
to<br>
 relieve by silly imprisonments or silly damages, while I knew
all<br>
 the time, by the light of my living common sense, that they
would<br>
 have been far better relieved by a kiss or a thrashing, or a
few<br>
 words of explanation, or a duel, or a tour in the West
Highlands.<br>
 Then, as this grew on me, there grew on me continuously the
sense<br>
 of a mountainous frivolity. Every word said in the court, a
whisper<br>
 or an oath, seemed more connected with life than the words I had
to<br>
 say. Then came the time when I publicly blasphemed the whole
bosh,<br>
 was classed as a madman and melted from public life."</p>

<p>Something in the atmosphere told me that it was not only
Rupert and<br>
 I who were listening with intensity to this statement.</p>

<p>"Well, I discovered that I could be of no real use. I
offered<br>
 myself privately as a purely moral judge to settle purely
moral<br>
 differences. Before very long these unofficial courts of
honour<br>
 (kept strictly secret) had spread over the whole of society.
People<br>
 were tried before me not for the practical trifles for which
nobody<br>
 cares, such as committing a murder, or keeping a dog without
a<br>
 licence. My criminals were tried for the faults which really
make<br>
 social life impossible. They were tried before me for
selfishness,<br>
 or for an impossible vanity, or for scandalmongering, or for<br>
 stinginess to guests or dependents. Of course these courts had
no<br>
 sort of real coercive powers. The fulfilment of their
punishments<br>
 rested entirely on the honour of the ladies and gentlemen
involved,<br>
 including the honour of the culprits. But you would be amazed
to<br>
 know how completely our orders were always obeyed. Only lately
I<br>
 had a most pleasing example. A maiden lady in South Kensington
whom<br>
 I had condemned to solitary confinement for being the means
of<br>
 breaking off an engagement through backbiting, absolutely
refused<br>
 to leave her prison, although some well-meaning persons had
been<br>
 inopportune enough to rescue her."</p>

<p>Rupert Grant was staring at his brother, his mouth fallen
agape.<br>
 So, for the matter of that, I expect, was I. This, then, was
the<br>
 explanation of the old lady's strange discontent and her
still<br>
 stranger content with her lot. She was one of the culprits of
his<br>
 Voluntary Criminal Court. She was one of the clients of his
Queer<br>
 Trade.</p>

<p>We were still dazed when we drank, amid a crash of glasses,
the<br>
 health of Basil's new judiciary. We had only a confused sense
of<br>
 everything having been put right, the sense men will have
when<br>
 they come into the presence of God. We dimly heard Basil
say:</p>

<p>"Mr P. G. Northover will now explain the Adventure and
Romance<br>
 Agency."</p>

<p>And we heard equally dimly Northover beginning the statement
he<br>
 had made long ago to Major Brown. Thus our epic ended where
it<br>
 had begun, like a true cycle.</p>

Please note neither this listing nor its contents are final til
midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement.
The official release date of all Project Gutenberg eBooks is at
Midnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month.  A
preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment
and editing by those who wish to do so.

Most people start at our Web sites at:
http://gutenberg.net or
http://promo.net/pg

These Web sites include award-winning information about Project
Gutenberg, including how to donate, how to help produce our new
eBooks, and how to subscribe to our email newsletter (free!).


Those of you who want to download any eBook before announcement
can get to them as follows, and just download by date.  This is
also a good way to get them instantly upon announcement, as the
indexes our cataloguers produce obviously take a while after an
announcement goes out in the Project Gutenberg Newsletter.

http://www.ibiblio.org/gutenberg/etext03 or
ftp://ftp.ibiblio.org/pub/docs/books/gutenberg/etext03

Or /etext02, 01, 00, 99, 98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90

Just search by the first five letters of the filename you want,
as it appears in our Newsletters.


Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
time it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours
to get any eBook selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.   Our
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If the value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
million dollars per hour in 2002 as we release over 100 new text
files per month:  1240 more eBooks in 2001 for a total of 4000+
We are already on our way to trying for 2000 more eBooks in 2002
If they reach just 1-2% of the world's population then the total
will reach over half a trillion eBooks given away by year's end.

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away 1 Trillion eBooks!
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is only about 4% of the present number of computer users.

(Three Pages)

***START**THE SMALL PRINT!**FOR PUBLIC DOMAIN EBOOKS**START***
Why is this "Small Print!" statement here? You know: lawyers.
They tell us you might sue us if there is something wrong with
your copy of this eBook, even if you got it for free from
someone other than us, and even if what's wrong is not our
fault. So, among other things, this "Small Print!" statement
disclaims most of our liability to you. It also tells you how
you may distribute copies of this eBook if you want to.

*BEFORE!* YOU USE OR READ THIS EBOOK
By using or reading any part of this PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
eBook, you indicate that you understand, agree to and accept
this "Small Print!" statement. If you do not, you can receive
a refund of the money (if any) you paid for this eBook by
sending a request within 30 days of receiving it to the person
you got it from. If you received this eBook on a physical
medium (such as a disk), you must return it with your request.

ABOUT PROJECT GUTENBERG-TM EBOOKS
This PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBook, like most PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBooks,
is a "public domain" work distributed by Professor Michael S. Hart
through the Project Gutenberg Association (the "Project").
Among other things, this means that no one owns a United States copyright
on or for this work, so the Project (and you!) can copy and
distribute it in the United States without permission and
without paying copyright royalties. Special rules, set forth
below, apply if you wish to copy and distribute this eBook
under the "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark.

Please do not use the "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark to market
any commercial products without permission.

To create these eBooks, the Project expends considerable
efforts to identify, transcribe and proofread public domain
works. Despite these efforts, the Project's eBooks and any
medium they may be on may contain "Defects". Among other
things, Defects may take the form of incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged
disk or other eBook medium, a computer virus, or computer
codes that damage or cannot be read by your equipment.

LIMITED WARRANTY; DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES
But for the "Right of Replacement or Refund" described below,
[1] Michael Hart and the Foundation (and any other party you may
receive this eBook from as a PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBook) disclaims
all liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including
legal fees, and [2] YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE OR
UNDER STRICT LIABILITY, OR FOR BREACH OF WARRANTY OR CONTRACT,
INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE
OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

If you discover a Defect in this eBook within 90 days of
receiving it, you can receive a refund of the money (if any)
you paid for it by sending an explanatory note within that
time to the person you received it from. If you received it
on a physical medium, you must return it with your note, and
such person may choose to alternatively give you a replacement
copy. If you received it electronically, such person may
choose to alternatively give you a second opportunity to
receive it electronically.

THIS EBOOK IS OTHERWISE PROVIDED TO YOU "AS-IS". NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, ARE MADE TO YOU AS
TO THE EBOOK OR ANY MEDIUM IT MAY BE ON, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

Some states do not allow disclaimers of implied warranties or
the exclusion or limitation of consequential damages, so the
above disclaimers and exclusions may not apply to you, and you
may have other legal rights.

INDEMNITY
You will indemnify and hold Michael Hart, the Foundation,
and its trustees and agents, and any volunteers associated
with the production and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm

     periodic) tax return.  Please contact us beforehand to
     let us know your plans and to work out the details.
