      Chapter 1. The Tremendous Adventures of Major Brown
    </h2>
    <p>
      Rabelais, or his wild illustrator Gustave Dore, must have had something to
      do with the designing of the things called flats in England and America.
      There is something entirely Gargantuan in the idea of economising space by
      piling houses on top of each other, front doors and all. And in the chaos
      and complexity of those perpendicular streets anything may dwell or
      happen, and it is in one of them, I believe, that the inquirer may find
      the offices of the Club of Queer Trades. It may be thought at the first
      glance that the name would attract and startle the passer-by, but nothing
      attracts or startles in these dim immense hives. The passer-by is only
      looking for his own melancholy destination, the Montenegro Shipping Agency
      or the London office of the Rutland Sentinel, and passes through the
      twilight passages as one passes through the twilight corridors of a dream.
      If the Thugs set up a Strangers' Assassination Company in one of the great
      buildings in Norfolk Street, and sent in a mild man in spectacles to
      answer inquiries, no inquiries would be made. And the Club of Queer Trades
      reigns in a great edifice hidden like a fossil in a mighty cliff of
      fossils.
    </p>
    <p>
      The nature of this society, such as we afterwards discovered it to be, is
      soon and simply told. It is an eccentric and Bohemian Club, of which the
      absolute condition of membership lies in this, that the candidate must
      have invented the method by which he earns his living. It must be an
      entirely new trade. The exact definition of this requirement is given in
      the two principal rules. First, it must not be a mere application or
      variation of an existing trade. Thus, for instance, the Club would not
      admit an insurance agent simply because instead of insuring men's
      furniture against being burnt in a fire, he insured, let us say, their
      trousers against being torn by a mad dog. The principle (as Sir Bradcock
      Burnaby-Bradcock, in the extraordinarily eloquent and soaring speech to
      the club on the occasion of the question being raised in the Stormby Smith
      affair, said wittily and keenly) is the same. Secondly, the trade must be
      a genuine commercial source of income, the support of its inventor. Thus
      the Club would not receive a man simply because he chose to pass his days
      collecting broken sardine tins, unless he could drive a roaring trade in
      them. Professor Chick made that quite clear. And when one remembers what
      Professor Chick's own new trade was, one doesn't know whether to laugh or
      cry.
    </p>
    <p>
      The discovery of this strange society was a curiously refreshing thing; to
      realize that there were ten new trades in the world was like looking at
      the first ship or the first plough. It made a man feel what he should
      feel, that he was still in the childhood of the world. That I should have
      come at last upon so singular a body was, I may say without vanity, not
      altogether singular, for I have a mania for belonging to as many societies
      as possible: I may be said to collect clubs, and I have accumulated a vast
      and fantastic variety of specimens ever since, in my audacious youth, I
      collected the Athenaeum. At some future day, perhaps, I may tell tales of
      some of the other bodies to which I have belonged. I will recount the
      doings of the Dead Man's Shoes Society (that superficially immoral, but
      darkly justifiable communion); I will explain the curious origin of the
      Cat and Christian, the name of which has been so shamefully
      misinterpreted; and the world shall know at last why the Institute of
      Typewriters coalesced with the Red Tulip League. Of the Ten Teacups, of
      course I dare not say a word. The first of my revelations, at any rate,
      shall be concerned with the Club of Queer Trades, which, as I have said,
      was one of this class, one which I was almost bound to come across sooner
      or later, because of my singular hobby. The wild youth of the metropolis
      call me facetiously 'The King of Clubs'. They also call me 'The Cherub',
      in allusion to the roseate and youthful appearance I have presented in my
      declining years. I only hope the spirits in the better world have as good
      dinners as I have. But the finding of the Club of Queer Trades has one
      very curious thing about it. The most curious thing about it is that it
      was not discovered by me; it was discovered by my friend Basil Grant, a
      star-gazer, a mystic, and a man who scarcely stirred out of his attic.
    </p>
    <p>
      Very few people knew anything of Basil; not because he was in the least
      unsociable, for if a man out of the street had walked into his rooms he
      would have kept him talking till morning. Few people knew him, because,
      like all poets, he could do without them; he welcomed a human face as he
      might welcome a sudden blend of colour in a sunset; but he no more felt
      the need of going out to parties than he felt the need of altering the
      sunset clouds. He lived in a queer and comfortable garret in the roofs of
      Lambeth. He was surrounded by a chaos of things that were in odd contrast
      to the slums around him; old fantastic books, swords, armour&mdash;the
      whole dust-hole of romanticism. But his face, amid all these quixotic
      relics, appeared curiously keen and modern&mdash;a powerful, legal face.
      And no one but I knew who he was.
    </p>
    <p>
      Long ago as it is, everyone remembers the terrible and grotesque scene
      that occurred in&mdash;, when one of the most acute and forcible of the
      English judges suddenly went mad on the bench. I had my own view of that
      occurrence; but about the facts themselves there is no question at all.
      For some months, indeed for some years, people had detected something
      curious in the judge's conduct. He seemed to have lost interest in the
      law, in which he had been beyond expression brilliant and terrible as a
      K.C., and to be occupied in giving personal and moral advice to the people
      concerned. He talked more like a priest or a doctor, and a very outspoken
      one at that. The first thrill was probably given when he said to a man who
      had attempted a crime of passion: &ldquo;I sentence you to three years
      imprisonment, under the firm, and solemn, and God-given conviction, that
      what you require is three months at the seaside.&rdquo; He accused criminals
      from the bench, not so much of their obvious legal crimes, but of things
      that had never been heard of in a court of justice, monstrous egoism, lack
      of humour, and morbidity deliberately encouraged. Things came to a head in
      that celebrated diamond case in which the Prime Minister himself, that
      brilliant patrician, had to come forward, gracefully and reluctantly, to
      give evidence against his valet. After the detailed life of the household
      had been thoroughly exhibited, the judge requested the Premier again to
      step forward, which he did with quiet dignity. The judge then said, in a
      sudden, grating voice: &ldquo;Get a new soul. That thing's not fit for a dog.
      Get a new soul.&rdquo; All this, of course, in the eyes of the sagacious, was
      premonitory of that melancholy and farcical day when his wits actually
      deserted him in open court. It was a libel case between two very eminent
      and powerful financiers, against both of whom charges of considerable
      defalcation were brought. The case was long and complex; the advocates
      were long and eloquent; but at last, after weeks of work and rhetoric, the
      time came for the great judge to give a summing-up; and one of his
      celebrated masterpieces of lucidity and pulverizing logic was eagerly
      looked for. He had spoken very little during the prolonged affair, and he
      looked sad and lowering at the end of it. He was silent for a few moments,
      and then burst into a stentorian song. His remarks (as reported) were as
      follows:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O Rowty-owty tiddly-owty Tiddly-owty tiddly-owty Highty-ighty
      tiddly-ighty Tiddly-ighty ow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He then retired from public life and took the garret in Lambeth.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was sitting there one evening, about six o'clock, over a glass of that
      gorgeous Burgundy which he kept behind a pile of black-letter folios; he
      was striding about the room, fingering, after a habit of his, one of the
      great swords in his collection; the red glare of the strong fire struck
      his square features and his fierce grey hair; his blue eyes were even
      unusually full of dreams, and he had opened his mouth to speak dreamily,
      when the door was flung open, and a pale, fiery man, with red hair and a
      huge furred overcoat, swung himself panting into the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sorry to bother you, Basil,&rdquo; he gasped. &ldquo;I took a liberty&mdash;made an
      appointment here with a man&mdash;a client&mdash;in five minutes&mdash;I
      beg your pardon, sir,&rdquo; and he gave me a bow of apology.
    </p>
    <p>
      Basil smiled at me. &ldquo;You didn't know,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that I had a practical
      brother. This is Rupert Grant, Esquire, who can and does all there is to
      be done. Just as I was a failure at one thing, he is a success at
      everything. I remember him as a journalist, a house-agent, a naturalist,
      an inventor, a publisher, a schoolmaster, a&mdash;what are you now,
      Rupert?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am and have been for some time,&rdquo; said Rupert, with some dignity, &ldquo;a
      private detective, and there's my client.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A loud rap at the door had cut him short, and, on permission being given,
      the door was thrown sharply open and a stout, dapper man walked swiftly
      into the room, set his silk hat with a clap on the table, and said, &ldquo;Good
      evening, gentlemen,&rdquo; with a stress on the last syllable that somehow
      marked him out as a martinet, military, literary and social. He had a
      large head streaked with black and grey, and an abrupt black moustache,
      which gave him a look of fierceness which was contradicted by his sad
      sea-blue eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Basil immediately said to me, &ldquo;Let us come into the next room, Gully,&rdquo; and
      was moving towards the door, but the stranger said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not at all. Friends remain. Assistance possibly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The moment I heard him speak I remembered who he was, a certain Major
      Brown I had met years before in Basil's society. I had forgotten
      altogether the black dandified figure and the large solemn head, but I
      remembered the peculiar speech, which consisted of only saying about a
      quarter of each sentence, and that sharply, like the crack of a gun. I do
      not know, it may have come from giving orders to troops.
    </p>
    <p>
      Major Brown was a V.C., and an able and distinguished soldier, but he was
      anything but a warlike person. Like many among the iron men who recovered
      British India, he was a man with the natural beliefs and tastes of an old
      maid. In his dress he was dapper and yet demure; in his habits he was
      precise to the point of the exact adjustment of a tea-cup. One enthusiasm
      he had, which was of the nature of a religion&mdash;the cultivation of
      pansies. And when he talked about his collection, his blue eyes glittered
      like a child's at a new toy, the eyes that had remained untroubled when
      the troops were roaring victory round Roberts at Candahar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Major,&rdquo; said Rupert Grant, with a lordly heartiness, flinging
      himself into a chair, &ldquo;what is the matter with you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yellow pansies. Coal-cellar. P. G. Northover,&rdquo; said the Major, with
      righteous indignation.
    </p>
    <p>
      We glanced at each other with inquisitiveness. Basil, who had his eyes
      shut in his abstracted way, said simply:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I beg your pardon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fact is. Street, you know, man, pansies. On wall. Death to me. Something.
      Preposterous.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We shook our heads gently. Bit by bit, and mainly by the seemingly sleepy
      assistance of Basil Grant, we pieced together the Major's fragmentary, but
      excited narration. It would be infamous to submit the reader to what we
      endured; therefore I will tell the story of Major Brown in my own words.
      But the reader must imagine the scene. The eyes of Basil closed as in a
      trance, after his habit, and the eyes of Rupert and myself getting rounder
      and rounder as we listened to one of the most astounding stories in the
      world, from the lips of the little man in black, sitting bolt upright in
      his chair and talking like a telegram.
    </p>
    <p>
      Major Brown was, I have said, a successful soldier, but by no means an
      enthusiastic one. So far from regretting his retirement on half-pay, it
      was with delight that he took a small neat villa, very like a doll's
      house, and devoted the rest of his life to pansies and weak tea. The
      thought that battles were over when he had once hung up his sword in the
      little front hall (along with two patent stew-pots and a bad
      water-colour), and betaken himself instead to wielding the rake in his
      little sunlit garden, was to him like having come into a harbour in
      heaven. He was Dutch-like and precise in his taste in gardening, and had,
      perhaps, some tendency to drill his flowers like soldiers. He was one of
      those men who are capable of putting four umbrellas in the stand rather
      than three, so that two may lean one way and two another; he saw life like
      a pattern in a freehand drawing-book. And assuredly he would not have
      believed, or even understood, any one who had told him that within a few
      yards of his brick paradise he was destined to be caught in a whirlpool of
      incredible adventure, such as he had never seen or dreamed of in the
      horrible jungle, or the heat of battle.
    </p>
    <p>
      One certain bright and windy afternoon, the Major, attired in his usual
      faultless manner, had set out for his usual constitutional. In crossing
      from one great residential thoroughfare to another, he happened to pass
      along one of those aimless-looking lanes which lie along the back-garden
      walls of a row of mansions, and which in their empty and discoloured
      appearance give one an odd sensation as of being behind the scenes of a
      theatre. But mean and sulky as the scene might be in the eyes of most of
      us, it was not altogether so in the Major's, for along the coarse gravel
      footway was coming a thing which was to him what the passing of a
      religious procession is to a devout person. A large, heavy man, with
      fish-blue eyes and a ring of irradiating red beard, was pushing before him
      a barrow, which was ablaze with incomparable flowers. There were splendid
      specimens of almost every order, but the Major's own favourite pansies
      predominated. The Major stopped and fell into conversation, and then into
      bargaining. He treated the man after the manner of collectors and other
      mad men, that is to say, he carefully and with a sort of anguish selected
      the best roots from the less excellent, praised some, disparaged others,
      made a subtle scale ranging from a thrilling worth and rarity to a
      degraded insignificance, and then bought them all. The man was just
      pushing off his barrow when he stopped and came close to the Major.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll tell you what, sir,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;If you're interested in them things,
      you just get on to that wall.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On the wall!&rdquo; cried the scandalised Major, whose conventional soul
      quailed within him at the thought of such fantastic trespass.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Finest show of yellow pansies in England in that there garden, sir,&rdquo;
       hissed the tempter. &ldquo;I'll help you up, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      How it happened no one will ever know but that positive enthusiasm of the
      Major's life triumphed over all its negative traditions, and with an easy
      leap and swing that showed that he was in no need of physical assistance,
      he stood on the wall at the end of the strange garden. The second after,
      the flapping of the frock-coat at his knees made him feel inexpressibly a
      fool. But the next instant all such trifling sentiments were swallowed up
      by the most appalling shock of surprise the old soldier had ever felt in
      all his bold and wandering existence. His eyes fell upon the garden, and
      there across a large bed in the centre of the lawn was a vast pattern of
      pansies; they were splendid flowers, but for once it was not their
      horticultural aspects that Major Brown beheld, for the pansies were
      arranged in gigantic capital letters so as to form the sentence:
    </p>
    <p>
      DEATH TO MAJOR BROWN
    </p>
    <p>
      A kindly looking old man, with white whiskers, was watering them. Brown
      looked sharply back at the road behind him; the man with the barrow had
      suddenly vanished. Then he looked again at the lawn with its incredible
      inscription. Another man might have thought he had gone mad, but Brown did
      not. When romantic ladies gushed over his V.C. and his military exploits,
      he sometimes felt himself to be a painfully prosaic person, but by the
      same token he knew he was incurably sane. Another man, again, might have
      thought himself a victim of a passing practical joke, but Brown could not
      easily believe this. He knew from his own quaint learning that the garden
      arrangement was an elaborate and expensive one; he thought it
      extravagantly improbable that any one would pour out money like water for
      a joke against him. Having no explanation whatever to offer, he admitted
      the fact to himself, like a clear-headed man, and waited as he would have
      done in the presence of a man with six legs.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this moment the stout old man with white whiskers looked up, and the
      watering can fell from his hand, shooting a swirl of water down the gravel
      path.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who on earth are you?&rdquo; he gasped, trembling violently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am Major Brown,&rdquo; said that individual, who was always cool in the hour
      of action.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old man gaped helplessly like some monstrous fish. At last he
      stammered wildly, &ldquo;Come down&mdash;come down here!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At your service,&rdquo; said the Major, and alighted at a bound on the grass
      beside him, without disarranging his silk hat.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old man turned his broad back and set off at a sort of waddling run
      towards the house, followed with swift steps by the Major. His guide led
      him through the back passages of a gloomy, but gorgeously appointed house,
      until they reached the door of the front room. Then the old man turned
      with a face of apoplectic terror dimly showing in the twilight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For heaven's sake,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;don't mention jackals.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then he threw open the door, releasing a burst of red lamplight, and ran
      downstairs with a clatter.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Major stepped into a rich, glowing room, full of red copper, and
      peacock and purple hangings, hat in hand. He had the finest manners in the
      world, and, though mystified, was not in the least embarrassed to see that
      the only occupant was a lady, sitting by the window, looking out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madam,&rdquo; he said, bowing simply, &ldquo;I am Major Brown.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sit down,&rdquo; said the lady; but she did not turn her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was a graceful, green-clad figure, with fiery red hair and a flavour
      of Bedford Park. &ldquo;You have come, I suppose,&rdquo; she said mournfully, &ldquo;to tax
      me about the hateful title-deeds.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have come, madam,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;to know what is the matter. To know why my
      name is written across your garden. Not amicably either.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He spoke grimly, for the thing had hit him. It is impossible to describe
      the effect produced on the mind by that quiet and sunny garden scene, the
      frame for a stunning and brutal personality. The evening air was still,
      and the grass was golden in the place where the little flowers he studied
      cried to heaven for his blood.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know I must not turn round,&rdquo; said the lady; &ldquo;every afternoon till the
      stroke of six I must keep my face turned to the street.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Some queer and unusual inspiration made the prosaic soldier resolute to
      accept these outrageous riddles without surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is almost six,&rdquo; he said; and even as he spoke the barbaric copper
      clock upon the wall clanged the first stroke of the hour. At the sixth the
      lady sprang up and turned on the Major one of the queerest and yet most
      attractive faces he had ever seen in his life; open, and yet tantalising,
      the face of an elf.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That makes the third year I have waited,&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;This is an
      anniversary. The waiting almost makes one wish the frightful thing would
      happen once and for all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And even as she spoke, a sudden rending cry broke the stillness. From low
      down on the pavement of the dim street (it was already twilight) a voice
      cried out with a raucous and merciless distinctness:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Major Brown, Major Brown, where does the jackal dwell?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Brown was decisive and silent in action. He strode to the front door and
      looked out. There was no sign of life in the blue gloaming of the street,
      where one or two lamps were beginning to light their lemon sparks. On
      returning, he found the lady in green trembling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is the end,&rdquo; she cried, with shaking lips; &ldquo;it may be death for both
      of us. Whenever&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But even as she spoke her speech was cloven by another hoarse proclamation
      from the dark street, again horribly articulate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Major Brown, Major Brown, how did the jackal die?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Brown dashed out of the door and down the steps, but again he was
      frustrated; there was no figure in sight, and the street was far too long
      and empty for the shouter to have run away. Even the rational Major was a
      little shaken as he returned in a certain time to the drawing-room.
      Scarcely had he done so than the terrific voice came:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Major Brown, Major Brown, where did&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Brown was in the street almost at a bound, and he was in time&mdash;in
      time to see something which at first glance froze the blood. The cries
      appeared to come from a decapitated head resting on the pavement.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next moment the pale Major understood. It was the head of a man thrust
      through the coal-hole in the street. The next moment, again, it had
      vanished, and Major Brown turned to the lady. &ldquo;Where's your coal-cellar?&rdquo;
       he said, and stepped out into the passage.
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked at him with wild grey eyes. &ldquo;You will not go down,&rdquo; she cried,
      &ldquo;alone, into the dark hole, with that beast?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is this the way?&rdquo; replied Brown, and descended the kitchen stairs three
      at a time. He flung open the door of a black cavity and stepped in,
      feeling in his pocket for matches. As his right hand was thus occupied, a
      pair of great slimy hands came out of the darkness, hands clearly
      belonging to a man of gigantic stature, and seized him by the back of the
      head. They forced him down, down in the suffocating darkness, a brutal
      image of destiny. But the Major's head, though upside down, was perfectly
      clear and intellectual. He gave quietly under the pressure until he had
      slid down almost to his hands and knees. Then finding the knees of the
      invisible monster within a foot of him, he simply put out one of his long,
      bony, and skilful hands, and gripping the leg by a muscle pulled it off
      the ground and laid the huge living man, with a crash, along the floor. He
      strove to rise, but Brown was on top like a cat. They rolled over and
      over. Big as the man was, he had evidently now no desire but to escape; he
      made sprawls hither and thither to get past the Major to the door, but
      that tenacious person had him hard by the coat collar and hung with the
      other hand to a beam. At length there came a strain in holding back this
      human bull, a strain under which Brown expected his hand to rend and part
      from the arm. But something else rent and parted; and the dim fat figure
      of the giant vanished out of the cellar, leaving the torn coat in the
      Major's hand; the only fruit of his adventure and the only clue to the
      mystery. For when he went up and out at the front door, the lady, the rich
      hangings, and the whole equipment of the house had disappeared. It had
      only bare boards and whitewashed walls.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The lady was in the conspiracy, of course,&rdquo; said Rupert, nodding. Major
      Brown turned brick red. &ldquo;I beg your pardon,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I think not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rupert raised his eyebrows and looked at him for a moment, but said
      nothing. When next he spoke he asked:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was there anything in the pockets of the coat?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There was sevenpence halfpenny in coppers and a threepenny-bit,&rdquo; said the
      Major carefully; &ldquo;there was a cigarette-holder, a piece of string, and
      this letter,&rdquo; and he laid it on the table. It ran as follows:
    </p>
    <p>
      Dear Mr Plover,
    </p>
    <p>
      I am annoyed to hear that some delay has occurred in the arrangements re
      Major Brown. Please see that he is attacked as per arrangement tomorrow
      The coal-cellar, of course.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yours faithfully, P. G. Northover.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rupert Grant was leaning forward listening with hawk-like eyes. He cut in:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it dated from anywhere?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&mdash;oh, yes!&rdquo; replied Brown, glancing upon the paper; &ldquo;14 Tanner's
      Court, North&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rupert sprang up and struck his hands together.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then why are we hanging here? Let's get along. Basil, lend me your
      revolver.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Basil was staring into the embers like a man in a trance; and it was some
      time before he answered:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't think you'll need it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps not,&rdquo; said Rupert, getting into his fur coat. &ldquo;One never knows.
      But going down a dark court to see criminals&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think they are criminals?&rdquo; asked his brother.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rupert laughed stoutly. &ldquo;Giving orders to a subordinate to strangle a
      harmless stranger in a coal-cellar may strike you as a very blameless
      experiment, but&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think they wanted to strangle the Major?&rdquo; asked Basil, in the same
      distant and monotonous voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear fellow, you've been asleep. Look at the letter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am looking at the letter,&rdquo; said the mad judge calmly; though, as a
      matter of fact, he was looking at the fire. &ldquo;I don't think it's the sort
      of letter one criminal would write to another.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear boy, you are glorious,&rdquo; cried Rupert, turning round, with
      laughter in his blue bright eyes. &ldquo;Your methods amaze me. Why, there is
      the letter. It is written, and it does give orders for a crime. You might
      as well say that the Nelson Column was not at all the sort of thing that
      was likely to be set up in Trafalgar Square.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Basil Grant shook all over with a sort of silent laughter, but did not
      otherwise move.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's rather good,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;but, of course, logic like that's not what
      is really wanted. It's a question of spiritual atmosphere. It's not a
      criminal letter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is. It's a matter of fact,&rdquo; cried the other in an agony of
      reasonableness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Facts,&rdquo; murmured Basil, like one mentioning some strange, far-off
      animals, &ldquo;how facts obscure the truth. I may be silly&mdash;in fact, I'm
      off my head&mdash;but I never could believe in that man&mdash;what's his
      name, in those capital stories?&mdash;Sherlock Holmes. Every detail points
      to something, certainly; but generally to the wrong thing. Facts point in
      all directions, it seems to me, like the thousands of twigs on a tree.
      It's only the life of the tree that has unity and goes up&mdash;only the
      green blood that springs, like a fountain, at the stars.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what the deuce else can the letter be but criminal?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We have eternity to stretch our legs in,&rdquo; replied the mystic. &ldquo;It can be
      an infinity of things. I haven't seen any of them&mdash;I've only seen the
      letter. I look at that, and say it's not criminal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then what's the origin of it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I haven't the vaguest idea.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then why don't you accept the ordinary explanation?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Basil continued for a little to glare at the coals, and seemed collecting
      his thoughts in a humble and even painful way. Then he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Suppose you went out into the moonlight. Suppose you passed through
      silent, silvery streets and squares until you came into an open and
      deserted space, set with a few monuments, and you beheld one dressed as a
      ballet girl dancing in the argent glimmer. And suppose you looked, and saw
      it was a man disguised. And suppose you looked again, and saw it was Lord
      Kitchener. What would you think?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He paused a moment, and went on:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You could not adopt the ordinary explanation. The ordinary explanation of
      putting on singular clothes is that you look nice in them; you would not
      think that Lord Kitchener dressed up like a ballet girl out of ordinary
      personal vanity. You would think it much more likely that he inherited a
      dancing madness from a great grandmother; or had been hypnotised at a
      seance; or threatened by a secret society with death if he refused the
      ordeal. With Baden-Powell, say, it might be a bet&mdash;but not with
      Kitchener. I should know all that, because in my public days I knew him
      quite well. So I know that letter quite well, and criminals quite well.
      It's not a criminal's letter. It's all atmospheres.&rdquo; And he closed his
      eyes and passed his hand over his forehead.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rupert and the Major were regarding him with a mixture of respect and
      pity. The former said,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I'm going, anyhow, and shall continue to think&mdash;until your
      spiritual mystery turns up&mdash;that a man who sends a note recommending
      a crime, that is, actually a crime that is actually carried out, at least
      tentatively, is, in all probability, a little casual in his moral tastes.
      Can I have that revolver?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; said Basil, getting up. &ldquo;But I am coming with you.&rdquo; And he
      flung an old cape or cloak round him, and took a sword-stick from the
      corner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You!&rdquo; said Rupert, with some surprise, &ldquo;you scarcely ever leave your hole
      to look at anything on the face of the earth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Basil fitted on a formidable old white hat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I scarcely ever,&rdquo; he said, with an unconscious and colossal arrogance,
      &ldquo;hear of anything on the face of the earth that I do not understand at
      once, without going to see it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And he led the way out into the purple night.
    </p>
    <p>
      We four swung along the flaring Lambeth streets, across Westminster
      Bridge, and along the Embankment in the direction of that part of Fleet
      Street which contained Tanner's Court. The erect, black figure of Major
      Brown, seen from behind, was a quaint contrast to the hound-like stoop and
      flapping mantle of young Rupert Grant, who adopted, with childlike
      delight, all the dramatic poses of the detective of fiction. The finest
      among his many fine qualities was his boyish appetite for the colour and
      poetry of London. Basil, who walked behind, with his face turned blindly
      to the stars, had the look of a somnambulist.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rupert paused at the corner of Tanner's Court, with a quiver of delight at
      danger, and gripped Basil's revolver in his great-coat pocket.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall we go in now?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not get police?&rdquo; asked Major Brown, glancing sharply up and down the
      street.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not sure,&rdquo; answered Rupert, knitting his brows. &ldquo;Of course, it's
      quite clear, the thing's all crooked. But there are three of us, and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shouldn't get the police,&rdquo; said Basil in a queer voice. Rupert glanced
      at him and stared hard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Basil,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;you're trembling. What's the matter&mdash;are you
      afraid?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cold, perhaps,&rdquo; said the Major, eyeing him. There was no doubt that he
      was shaking.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last, after a few moments' scrutiny, Rupert broke into a curse.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're laughing,&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;I know that confounded, silent, shaky laugh
      of yours. What the deuce is the amusement, Basil? Here we are, all three
      of us, within a yard of a den of ruffians&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I shouldn't call the police,&rdquo; said Basil. &ldquo;We four heroes are quite
      equal to a host,&rdquo; and he continued to quake with his mysterious mirth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rupert turned with impatience and strode swiftly down the court, the rest
      of us following. When he reached the door of No. 14 he turned abruptly,
      the revolver glittering in his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stand close,&rdquo; he said in the voice of a commander. &ldquo;The scoundrel may be
      attempting an escape at this moment. We must fling open the door and rush
      in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The four of us cowered instantly under the archway, rigid, except for the
      old judge and his convulsion of merriment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; hissed Rupert Grant, turning his pale face and burning eyes
      suddenly over his shoulder, &ldquo;when I say 'Four', follow me with a rush. If
      I say 'Hold him', pin the fellows down, whoever they are. If I say 'Stop',
      stop. I shall say that if there are more than three. If they attack us I
      shall empty my revolver on them. Basil, have your sword-stick ready. Now&mdash;one,
      two three, four!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With the sound of the word the door burst open, and we fell into the room
      like an invasion, only to stop dead.
    </p>
    <p>
      The room, which was an ordinary and neatly appointed office, appeared, at
      the first glance, to be empty. But on a second and more careful glance, we
      saw seated behind a very large desk with pigeonholes and drawers of
      bewildering multiplicity, a small man with a black waxed moustache, and
      the air of a very average clerk, writing hard. He looked up as we came to
      a standstill.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you knock?&rdquo; he asked pleasantly. &ldquo;I am sorry if I did not hear. What
      can I do for you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a doubtful pause, and then, by general consent, the Major
      himself, the victim of the outrage, stepped forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      The letter was in his hand, and he looked unusually grim.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is your name P. G. Northover?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is my name,&rdquo; replied the other, smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think,&rdquo; said Major Brown, with an increase in the dark glow of his
      face, &ldquo;that this letter was written by you.&rdquo; And with a loud clap he
      struck open the letter on the desk with his clenched fist. The man called
      Northover looked at it with unaffected interest and merely nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, sir,&rdquo; said the Major, breathing hard, &ldquo;what about that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What about it, precisely,&rdquo; said the man with the moustache.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am Major Brown,&rdquo; said that gentleman sternly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Northover bowed. &ldquo;Pleased to meet you, sir. What have you to say to me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say!&rdquo; cried the Major, loosing a sudden tempest; &ldquo;why, I want this
      confounded thing settled. I want&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly, sir,&rdquo; said Northover, jumping up with a slight elevation of
      the eyebrows. &ldquo;Will you take a chair for a moment.&rdquo; And he pressed an
      electric bell just above him, which thrilled and tinkled in a room beyond.
      The Major put his hand on the back of the chair offered him, but stood
      chafing and beating the floor with his polished boot.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next moment an inner glass door was opened, and a fair, weedy, young
      man, in a frock-coat, entered from within.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr Hopson,&rdquo; said Northover, &ldquo;this is Major Brown. Will you please finish
      that thing for him I gave you this morning and bring it in?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; said Mr Hopson, and vanished like lightning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will excuse me, gentlemen,&rdquo; said the egregious Northover, with his
      radiant smile, &ldquo;if I continue to work until Mr Hopson is ready. I have
      some books that must be cleared up before I get away on my holiday
      tomorrow. And we all like a whiff of the country, don't we? Ha! ha!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The criminal took up his pen with a childlike laugh, and a silence ensued;
      a placid and busy silence on the part of Mr P. G. Northover; a raging
      silence on the part of everybody else.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length the scratching of Northover's pen in the stillness was mingled
      with a knock at the door, almost simultaneous with the turning of the
      handle, and Mr Hopson came in again with the same silent rapidity, placed
      a paper before his principal, and disappeared again.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man at the desk pulled and twisted his spiky moustache for a few
      moments as he ran his eye up and down the paper presented to him. He took
      up his pen, with a slight, instantaneous frown, and altered something,
      muttering&mdash;&ldquo;Careless.&rdquo; Then he read it again with the same
      impenetrable reflectiveness, and finally handed it to the frantic Brown,
      whose hand was beating the devil's tattoo on the back of the chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think you will find that all right, Major,&rdquo; he said briefly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Major looked at it; whether he found it all right or not will appear
      later, but he found it like this:
    </p>

  A Remittance will oblige.
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What,&rdquo; said Brown, after a dead pause, and with eyes that seemed slowly
      rising out of his head, &ldquo;What in heaven's name is this?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; repeated Northover, cocking his eyebrow with amusement.
      &ldquo;It's your account, of course.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My account!&rdquo; The Major's ideas appeared to be in a vague stampede. &ldquo;My
      account! And what have I got to do with it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Northover, laughing outright, &ldquo;naturally I prefer you to pay
      it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Major's hand was still resting on the back of the chair as the words
      came. He scarcely stirred otherwise, but he lifted the chair bodily into
      the air with one hand and hurled it at Northover's head.
    </p>
    <p>
      The legs crashed against the desk, so that Northover only got a blow on
      the elbow as he sprang up with clenched fists, only to be seized by the
      united rush of the rest of us. The chair had fallen clattering on the
      empty floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me go, you scamps,&rdquo; he shouted. &ldquo;Let me&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stand still,&rdquo; cried Rupert authoritatively. &ldquo;Major Brown's action is
      excusable. The abominable crime you have attempted&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A customer has a perfect right,&rdquo; said Northover hotly, &ldquo;to question an
      alleged overcharge, but, confound it all, not to throw furniture.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What, in God's name, do you mean by your customers and overcharges?&rdquo;
       shrieked Major Brown, whose keen feminine nature, steady in pain or
      danger, became almost hysterical in the presence of a long and
      exasperating mystery. &ldquo;Who are you? I've never seen you or your insolent
      tomfool bills. I know one of your cursed brutes tried to choke me&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mad,&rdquo; said Northover, gazing blankly round; &ldquo;all of them mad. I didn't
      know they travelled in quartettes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Enough of this prevarication,&rdquo; said Rupert; &ldquo;your crimes are discovered.
      A policeman is stationed at the corner of the court. Though only a private
      detective myself, I will take the responsibility of telling you that
      anything you say&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mad,&rdquo; repeated Northover, with a weary air.
    </p>
    <p>
      And at this moment, for the first time, there struck in among them the
      strange, sleepy voice of Basil Grant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Major Brown,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;may I ask you a question?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Major turned his head with an increased bewilderment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You?&rdquo; he cried; &ldquo;certainly, Mr Grant.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can you tell me,&rdquo; said the mystic, with sunken head and lowering brow, as
      he traced a pattern in the dust with his sword-stick, &ldquo;can you tell me
      what was the name of the man who lived in your house before you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The unhappy Major was only faintly more disturbed by this last and futile
      irrelevancy, and he answered vaguely:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I think so; a man named Gurney something&mdash;a name with a hyphen&mdash;Gurney-Brown;
      that was it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And when did the house change hands?&rdquo; said Basil, looking up sharply. His
      strange eyes were burning brilliantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I came in last month,&rdquo; said the Major.
    </p>
    <p>
      And at the mere word the criminal Northover suddenly fell into his great
      office chair and shouted with a volleying laughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! it's too perfect&mdash;it's too exquisite,&rdquo; he gasped, beating the
      arms with his fists. He was laughing deafeningly; Basil Grant was laughing
      voicelessly; and the rest of us only felt that our heads were like
      weathercocks in a whirlwind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Confound it, Basil,&rdquo; said Rupert, stamping. &ldquo;If you don't want me to go
      mad and blow your metaphysical brains out, tell me what all this means.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Northover rose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Permit me, sir, to explain,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;And, first of all, permit me to
      apologize to you, Major Brown, for a most abominable and unpardonable
      blunder, which has caused you menace and inconvenience, in which, if you
      will allow me to say so, you have behaved with astonishing courage and
      dignity. Of course you need not trouble about the bill. We will stand the
      loss.&rdquo; And, tearing the paper across, he flung the halves into the
      waste-paper basket and bowed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Poor Brown's face was still a picture of distraction. &ldquo;But I don't even
      begin to understand,&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;What bill? what blunder? what loss?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr P. G. Northover advanced in the centre of the room, thoughtfully, and
      with a great deal of unconscious dignity. On closer consideration, there
      were apparent about him other things beside a screwed moustache,
      especially a lean, sallow face, hawk-like, and not without a careworn
      intelligence. Then he looked up abruptly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know where you are, Major?&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God knows I don't,&rdquo; said the warrior, with fervour.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are standing,&rdquo; replied Northover, &ldquo;in the office of the Adventure and
      Romance Agency, Limited.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what's that?&rdquo; blankly inquired Brown.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man of business leaned over the back of the chair, and fixed his dark
      eyes on the other's face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Major,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;did you ever, as you walked along the empty street upon
      some idle afternoon, feel the utter hunger for something to happen&mdash;something,
      in the splendid words of Walt Whitman: 'Something pernicious and dread;
      something far removed from a puny and pious life; something unproved;
      something in a trance; something loosed from its anchorage, and driving
      free.' Did you ever feel that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly not,&rdquo; said the Major shortly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I must explain with more elaboration,&rdquo; said Mr Northover, with a
      sigh. &ldquo;The Adventure and Romance Agency has been started to meet a great
      modern desire. On every side, in conversation and in literature, we hear
      of the desire for a larger theatre of events for something to waylay us
      and lead us splendidly astray. Now the man who feels this desire for a
      varied life pays a yearly or a quarterly sum to the Adventure and Romance
      Agency; in return, the Adventure and Romance Agency undertakes to surround
      him with startling and weird events. As a man is leaving his front door,
      an excited sweep approaches him and assures him of a plot against his
      life; he gets into a cab, and is driven to an opium den; he receives a
      mysterious telegram or a dramatic visit, and is immediately in a vortex of
      incidents. A very picturesque and moving story is first written by one of
      the staff of distinguished novelists who are at present hard at work in
      the adjoining room. Yours, Major Brown (designed by our Mr Grigsby), I
      consider peculiarly forcible and pointed; it is almost a pity you did not
      see the end of it. I need scarcely explain further the monstrous mistake.
      Your predecessor in your present house, Mr Gurney-Brown, was a subscriber
      to our agency, and our foolish clerks, ignoring alike the dignity of the
      hyphen and the glory of military rank, positively imagined that Major
      Brown and Mr Gurney-Brown were the same person. Thus you were suddenly
      hurled into the middle of another man's story.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How on earth does the thing work?&rdquo; asked Rupert Grant, with bright and
      fascinated eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We believe that we are doing a noble work,&rdquo; said Northover warmly. &ldquo;It
      has continually struck us that there is no element in modern life that is
      more lamentable than the fact that the modern man has to seek all artistic
      existence in a sedentary state. If he wishes to float into fairyland, he
      reads a book; if he wishes to dash into the thick of battle, he reads a
      book; if he wishes to soar into heaven, he reads a book; if he wishes to
      slide down the banisters, he reads a book. We give him these visions, but
      we give him exercise at the same time, the necessity of leaping from wall
      to wall, of fighting strange gentlemen, of running down long streets from
      pursuers&mdash;all healthy and pleasant exercises. We give him a glimpse
      of that great morning world of Robin Hood or the Knights Errant, when one
      great game was played under the splendid sky. We give him back his
      childhood, that godlike time when we can act stories, be our own heroes,
      and at the same instant dance and dream.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Basil gazed at him curiously. The most singular psychological discovery
      had been reserved to the end, for as the little business man ceased
      speaking he had the blazing eyes of a fanatic.
    </p>
    <p>
      Major Brown received the explanation with complete simplicity and good
      humour.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course; awfully dense, sir,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;No doubt at all, the scheme
      excellent. But I don't think&mdash;&rdquo; He paused a moment, and looked
      dreamily out of the window. &ldquo;I don't think you will find me in it.
      Somehow, when one's seen&mdash;seen the thing itself, you know&mdash;blood
      and men screaming, one feels about having a little house and a little
      hobby; in the Bible, you know, 'There remaineth a rest'.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Northover bowed. Then after a pause he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gentlemen, may I offer you my card. If any of the rest of you desire, at
      any time, to communicate with me, despite Major Brown's view of the matter&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should be obliged for your card, sir,&rdquo; said the Major, in his abrupt
      but courteous voice. &ldquo;Pay for chair.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The agent of Romance and Adventure handed his card, laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      It ran, &ldquo;P. G. Northover, B.A., C.Q.T., Adventure and Romance Agency, 14
      Tanner's Court, Fleet Street.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What on earth is 'C.QT.'?&rdquo; asked Rupert Grant, looking over the Major's
      shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't you know?&rdquo; returned Northover. &ldquo;Haven't you ever heard of the Club
      of Queer Trades?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There seems to be a confounded lot of funny things we haven't heard of,&rdquo;
       said the little Major reflectively. &ldquo;What's this one?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Club of Queer Trades is a society consisting exclusively of people
      who have invented some new and curious way of making money. I was one of
      the earliest members.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You deserve to be,&rdquo; said Basil, taking up his great white hat, with a
      smile, and speaking for the last time that evening.
    </p>
    <p>
      When they had passed out the Adventure and Romance agent wore a queer
      smile, as he trod down the fire and locked up his desk. &ldquo;A fine chap, that
      Major; when one hasn't a touch of the poet one stands some chance of being
      a poem. But to think of such a clockwork little creature of all people
      getting into the nets of one of Grigsby's tales,&rdquo; and he laughed out aloud
      in the silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just as the laugh echoed away, there came a sharp knock at the door. An
      owlish head, with dark moustaches, was thrust in, with deprecating and
      somewhat absurd inquiry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! back again, Major?&rdquo; cried Northover in surprise. &ldquo;What can I do for
      you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Major shuffled feverishly into the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's horribly absurd,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Something must have got started in me
      that I never knew before. But upon my soul I feel the most desperate
      desire to know the end of it all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The end of it all?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the Major. &ldquo;'Jackals', and the title-deeds, and 'Death to
      Major Brown'.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The agent's face grew grave, but his eyes were amused.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am terribly sorry, Major,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;but what you ask is impossible. I
      don't know any one I would sooner oblige than you; but the rules of the
      agency are strict. The Adventures are confidential; you are an outsider; I
      am not allowed to let you know an inch more than I can help. I do hope you
      understand&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is no one,&rdquo; said Brown, &ldquo;who understands discipline better than I
      do. Thank you very much. Good night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And the little man withdrew for the last time.
    </p>
    <p>
      He married Miss Jameson, the lady with the red hair and the green
      garments. She was an actress, employed (with many others) by the Romance
      Agency; and her marriage with the prim old veteran caused some stir in her
      languid and intellectualized set. She always replied very quietly that she
      had met scores of men who acted splendidly in the charades provided for
      them by Northover, but that she had only met one man who went down into a
      coal-cellar when he really thought it contained a murderer.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Major and she are living as happily as birds, in an absurd villa, and
      the former has taken to smoking. Otherwise he is unchanged&mdash;except,
      perhaps, there are moments when, alert and full of feminine unselfishness
      as the Major is by nature, he falls into a trance of abstraction. Then his
      wife recognizes with a concealed smile, by the blind look in his blue
      eyes, that he is wondering what were the title-deeds, and why he was not
      allowed to mention jackals. But, like so many old soldiers, Brown is
      religious, and believes that he will realize the rest of those purple
      adventures in a better world.

    <h2>
      Chapter 2. The Painful Fall of a Great Reputation
    </h2>
    <p>
      Basil Grant and I were talking one day in what is perhaps the most perfect
      place for talking on earth&mdash;the top of a tolerably deserted tramcar.
      To talk on the top of a hill is superb, but to talk on the top of a flying
      hill is a fairy tale.
    </p>
    <p>
      The vast blank space of North London was flying by; the very pace gave us
      a sense of its immensity and its meanness. It was, as it were, a base
      infinitude, a squalid eternity, and we felt the real horror of the poor
      parts of London, the horror that is so totally missed and misrepresented
      by the sensational novelists who depict it as being a matter of narrow
      streets, filthy houses, criminals and maniacs, and dens of vice. In a
      narrow street, in a den of vice, you do not expect civilization, you do
      not expect order. But the horror of this was the fact that there was
      civilization, that there was order, but that civilisation only showed its
      morbidity, and order only its monotony. No one would say, in going through
      a criminal slum, &ldquo;I see no statues. I notice no cathedrals.&rdquo; But here
      there were public buildings; only they were mostly lunatic asylums. Here
      there were statues; only they were mostly statues of railway engineers and
      philanthropists&mdash;two dingy classes of men united by their common
      contempt for the people. Here there were churches; only they were the
      churches of dim and erratic sects, Agapemonites or Irvingites. Here, above
      all, there were broad roads and vast crossings and tramway lines and
      hospitals and all the real marks of civilization. But though one never
      knew, in one sense, what one would see next, there was one thing we knew
      we should not see&mdash;anything really great, central, of the first
      class, anything that humanity had adored. And with revulsion indescribable
      our emotions returned, I think, to those really close and crooked entries,
      to those really mean streets, to those genuine slums which lie round the
      Thames and the City, in which nevertheless a real possibility remains that
      at any chance corner the great cross of the great cathedral of Wren may
      strike down the street like a thunderbolt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you must always remember also,&rdquo; said Grant to me, in his heavy
      abstracted way, when I had urged this view, &ldquo;that the very vileness of the
      life of these ordered plebeian places bears witness to the victory of the
      human soul. I agree with you. I agree that they have to live in something
      worse than barbarism. They have to live in a fourth-rate civilization. But
      yet I am practically certain that the majority of people here are good
      people. And being good is an adventure far more violent and daring than
      sailing round the world. Besides&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go on,&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      No answer came.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go on,&rdquo; I said, looking up.
    </p>
    <p>
      The big blue eyes of Basil Grant were standing out of his head and he was
      paying no attention to me. He was staring over the side of the tram.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is the matter?&rdquo; I asked, peering over also.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is very odd,&rdquo; said Grant at last, grimly, &ldquo;that I should have been
      caught out like this at the very moment of my optimism. I said all these
      people were good, and there is the wickedest man in England.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where?&rdquo; I asked, leaning over further, &ldquo;where?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I was right enough,&rdquo; he went on, in that strange continuous and
      sleepy tone which always angered his hearers at acute moments, &ldquo;I was
      right enough when I said all these people were good. They are heroes; they
      are saints. Now and then they may perhaps steal a spoon or two; they may
      beat a wife or two with the poker. But they are saints all the same; they
      are angels; they are robed in white; they are clad with wings and haloes&mdash;at
      any rate compared to that man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Which man?&rdquo; I cried again, and then my eye caught the figure at which
      Basil's bull's eyes were glaring.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was a slim, smooth person, passing very quickly among the quickly
      passing crowd, but though there was nothing about him sufficient to
      attract a startled notice, there was quite enough to demand a curious
      consideration when once that notice was attracted. He wore a black
      top-hat, but there was enough in it of those strange curves whereby the
      decadent artist of the eighties tried to turn the top-hat into something
      as rhythmic as an Etruscan vase. His hair, which was largely grey, was
      curled with the instinct of one who appreciated the gradual beauty of grey
      and silver. The rest of his face was oval and, I thought, rather Oriental;
      he had two black tufts of moustache.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What has he done?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not sure of the details,&rdquo; said Grant, &ldquo;but his besetting sin is a
      desire to intrigue to the disadvantage of others. Probably he has adopted
      some imposture or other to effect his plan.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What plan?&rdquo; I asked. &ldquo;If you know all about him, why don't you tell me
      why he is the wickedest man in England? What is his name?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Basil Grant stared at me for some moments.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think you've made a mistake in my meaning,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I don't know his
      name. I never saw him before in my life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never saw him before!&rdquo; I cried, with a kind of anger; &ldquo;then what in
      heaven's name do you mean by saying that he is the wickedest man in
      England?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I meant what I said,&rdquo; said Basil Grant calmly. &ldquo;The moment I saw that
      man, I saw all these people stricken with a sudden and splendid innocence.
      I saw that while all ordinary poor men in the streets were being
      themselves, he was not being himself. I saw that all the men in these
      slums, cadgers, pickpockets, hooligans, are all, in the deepest sense,
      trying to be good. And I saw that that man was trying to be evil.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But if you never saw him before&mdash;&rdquo; I began.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In God's name, look at his face,&rdquo; cried out Basil in a voice that
      startled the driver. &ldquo;Look at the eyebrows. They mean that infernal pride
      which made Satan so proud that he sneered even at heaven when he was one
      of the first angels in it. Look at his moustaches, they are so grown as to
      insult humanity. In the name of the sacred heavens look at his hair. In
      the name of God and the stars, look at his hat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I stirred uncomfortably.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, after all,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;this is very fanciful&mdash;perfectly absurd.
      Look at the mere facts. You have never seen the man before, you&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, the mere facts,&rdquo; he cried out in a kind of despair. &ldquo;The mere facts!
      Do you really admit&mdash;are you still so sunk in superstitions, so
      clinging to dim and prehistoric altars, that you believe in facts? Do you
      not trust an immediate impression?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, an immediate impression may be,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;a little less practical
      than facts.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bosh,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;On what else is the whole world run but immediate
      impressions? What is more practical? My friend, the philosophy of this
      world may be founded on facts, its business is run on spiritual
      impressions and atmospheres. Why do you refuse or accept a clerk? Do you
      measure his skull? Do you read up his physiological state in a handbook?
      Do you go upon facts at all? Not a scrap. You accept a clerk who may save
      your business&mdash;you refuse a clerk that may rob your till, entirely
      upon those immediate mystical impressions under the pressure of which I
      pronounce, with a perfect sense of certainty and sincerity, that that man
      walking in that street beside us is a humbug and a villain of some kind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You always put things well,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;but, of course, such things cannot
      immediately be put to the test.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Basil sprang up straight and swayed with the swaying car.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us get off and follow him,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I bet you five pounds it will
      turn out as I say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And with a scuttle, a jump, and a run, we were off the car.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man with the curved silver hair and the curved Eastern face walked
      along for some time, his long splendid frock-coat flying behind him. Then
      he swung sharply out of the great glaring road and disappeared down an
      ill-lit alley. We swung silently after him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is an odd turning for a man of that kind to take,&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A man of what kind?&rdquo; asked my friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;a man with that kind of expression and those boots. I
      thought it rather odd, to tell the truth, that he should be in this part
      of the world at all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, yes,&rdquo; said Basil, and said no more.
    </p>
    <p>
      We tramped on, looking steadily in front of us. The elegant figure, like
      the figure of a black swan, was silhouetted suddenly against the glare of
      intermittent gaslight and then swallowed again in night. The intervals
      between the lights were long, and a fog was thickening the whole city. Our
      pace, therefore, had become swift and mechanical between the lamp-posts;
      but Basil came to a standstill suddenly like a reined horse; I stopped
      also. We had almost run into the man. A great part of the solid darkness
      in front of us was the darkness of his body.
    </p>
    <p>
      At first I thought he had turned to face us. But though we were hardly a
      yard off he did not realize that we were there. He tapped four times on a
      very low and dirty door in the dark, crabbed street. A gleam of gas cut
      the darkness as it opened slowly. We listened intently, but the interview
      was short and simple and inexplicable as an interview could be. Our
      exquisite friend handed in what looked like a paper or a card and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At once. Take a cab.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A heavy, deep voice from inside said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Right you are.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And with a click we were in the blackness again, and striding after the
      striding stranger through a labyrinth of London lanes, the lights just
      helping us. It was only five o'clock, but winter and the fog had made it
      like midnight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is really an extraordinary walk for the patent-leather boots,&rdquo; I
      repeated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know,&rdquo; said Basil humbly. &ldquo;It leads to Berkeley Square.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As I tramped on I strained my eyes through the dusky atmosphere and tried
      to make out the direction described. For some ten minutes I wondered and
      doubted; at the end of that I saw that my friend was right. We were coming
      to the great dreary spaces of fashionable London&mdash;more dreary, one
      must admit, even than the dreary plebeian spaces.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is very extraordinary!&rdquo; said Basil Grant, as we turned into Berkeley
      Square.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is extraordinary?&rdquo; I asked. &ldquo;I thought you said it was quite
      natural.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not wonder,&rdquo; answered Basil, &ldquo;at his walking through nasty streets;
      I do not wonder at his going to Berkeley Square. But I do wonder at his
      going to the house of a very good man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What very good man?&rdquo; I asked with exasperation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The operation of time is a singular one,&rdquo; he said with his imperturbable
      irrelevancy. &ldquo;It is not a true statement of the case to say that I have
      forgotten my career when I was a judge and a public man. I remember it all
      vividly, but it is like remembering some novel. But fifteen years ago I
      knew this square as well as Lord Rosebery does, and a confounded long
      sight better than that man who is going up the steps of old Beaumont's
      house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is old Beaumont?&rdquo; I asked irritably.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A perfectly good fellow. Lord Beaumont of Foxwood&mdash;don't you know
      his name? He is a man of transparent sincerity, a nobleman who does more
      work than a navvy, a socialist, an anarchist, I don't know what; anyhow,
      he's a philosopher and philanthropist. I admit he has the slight
      disadvantage of being, beyond all question, off his head. He has that real
      disadvantage which has arisen out of the modern worship of progress and
      novelty; and he thinks anything odd and new must be an advance. If you
      went to him and proposed to eat your grandmother, he would agree with you,
      so long as you put it on hygienic and public grounds, as a cheap
      alternative to cremation. So long as you progress fast enough it seems a
      matter of indifference to him whether you are progressing to the stars or
      the devil. So his house is filled with an endless succession of literary
      and political fashions; men who wear long hair because it is romantic; men
      who wear short hair because it is medical; men who walk on their feet only
      to exercise their hands; and men who walk on their hands for fear of
      tiring their feet. But though the inhabitants of his salons are generally
      fools, like himself, they are almost always, like himself, good men. I am
      really surprised to see a criminal enter there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My good fellow,&rdquo; I said firmly, striking my foot on the pavement, &ldquo;the
      truth of this affair is very simple. To use your own eloquent language,
      you have the 'slight disadvantage' of being off your head. You see a total
      stranger in a public street; you choose to start certain theories about
      his eyebrows. You then treat him as a burglar because he enters an honest
      man's door. The thing is too monstrous. Admit that it is, Basil, and come
      home with me. Though these people are still having tea, yet with the
      distance we have to go, we shall be late for dinner.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Basil's eyes were shining in the twilight like lamps.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that I had outlived vanity.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you want now?&rdquo; I cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want,&rdquo; he cried out, &ldquo;what a girl wants when she wears her new frock; I
      want what a boy wants when he goes in for a clanging match with a monitor&mdash;I
      want to show somebody what a fine fellow I am. I am as right about that
      man as I am about your having a hat on your head. You say it cannot be
      tested. I say it can. I will take you to see my old friend Beaumont. He is
      a delightful man to know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you really mean&mdash;?&rdquo; I began.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will apologize,&rdquo; he said calmly, &ldquo;for our not being dressed for a
      call,&rdquo; and walking across the vast misty square, he walked up the dark
      stone steps and rang at the bell.
    </p>
    <p>
      A severe servant in black and white opened the door to us: on receiving my
      friend's name his manner passed in a flash from astonishment to respect.
      We were ushered into the house very quickly, but not so quickly but that
      our host, a white-haired man with a fiery face, came out quickly to meet
      us.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear fellow,&rdquo; he cried, shaking Basil's hand again and again, &ldquo;I have
      not seen you for years. Have you been&mdash;er&mdash;&rdquo; he said, rather
      wildly, &ldquo;have you been in the country?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not for all that time,&rdquo; answered Basil, smiling. &ldquo;I have long given up my
      official position, my dear Philip, and have been living in a deliberate
      retirement. I hope I do not come at an inopportune moment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An inopportune moment,&rdquo; cried the ardent gentleman. &ldquo;You come at the most
      opportune moment I could imagine. Do you know who is here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not,&rdquo; answered Grant, with gravity. Even as he spoke a roar of
      laughter came from the inner room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Basil,&rdquo; said Lord Beaumont solemnly, &ldquo;I have Wimpole here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And who is Wimpole?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Basil,&rdquo; cried the other, &ldquo;you must have been in the country. You must
      have been in the antipodes. You must have been in the moon. Who is
      Wimpole? Who was Shakespeare?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As to who Shakespeare was,&rdquo; answered my friend placidly, &ldquo;my views go no
      further than thinking that he was not Bacon. More probably he was Mary
      Queen of Scots. But as to who Wimpole is&mdash;&rdquo; and his speech also was
      cloven with a roar of laughter from within.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wimpole!&rdquo; cried Lord Beaumont, in a sort of ecstasy. &ldquo;Haven't you heard
      of the great modern wit? My dear fellow, he has turned conversation, I do
      not say into an art&mdash;for that, perhaps, it always was but into a
      great art, like the statuary of Michael Angelo&mdash;an art of
      masterpieces. His repartees, my good friend, startle one like a man shot
      dead. They are final; they are&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again there came the hilarious roar from the room, and almost with the
      very noise of it, a big, panting apoplectic old gentleman came out of the
      inner house into the hall where we were standing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, my dear chap,&rdquo; began Lord Beaumont hastily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I tell you, Beaumont, I won't stand it,&rdquo; exploded the large old
      gentleman. &ldquo;I won't be made game of by a twopenny literary adventurer like
      that. I won't be made a guy. I won't&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, come,&rdquo; said Beaumont feverishly. &ldquo;Let me introduce you. This is Mr
      Justice Grant&mdash;that is, Mr Grant. Basil, I am sure you have heard of
      Sir Walter Cholmondeliegh.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who has not?&rdquo; asked Grant, and bowed to the worthy old baronet, eyeing
      him with some curiosity. He was hot and heavy in his momentary anger, but
      even that could not conceal the noble though opulent outline of his face
      and body, the florid white hair, the Roman nose, the body stalwart though
      corpulent, the chin aristocratic though double. He was a magnificent
      courtly gentleman; so much of a gentleman that he could show an
      unquestionable weakness of anger without altogether losing dignity; so
      much of a gentleman that even his faux pas were well-bred.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am distressed beyond expression, Beaumont,&rdquo; he said gruffly, &ldquo;to fail
      in respect to these gentlemen, and even more especially to fail in it in
      your house. But it is not you or they that are in any way concerned, but
      that flashy half-caste jackanapes&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this moment a young man with a twist of red moustache and a sombre air
      came out of the inner room. He also did not seem to be greatly enjoying
      the intellectual banquet within.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think you remember my friend and secretary, Mr Drummond,&rdquo; said Lord
      Beaumont, turning to Grant, &ldquo;even if you only remember him as a
      schoolboy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perfectly,&rdquo; said the other. Mr Drummond shook hands pleasantly and
      respectfully, but the cloud was still on his brow. Turning to Sir Walter
      Cholmondeliegh, he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was sent by Lady Beaumont to express her hope that you were not going
      yet, Sir Walter. She says she has scarcely seen anything of you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The old gentleman, still red in the face, had a temporary internal
      struggle; then his good manners triumphed, and with a gesture of obeisance
      and a vague utterance of, &ldquo;If Lady Beaumont... a lady, of course,&rdquo; he
      followed the young man back into the salon. He had scarcely been deposited
      there half a minute before another peal of laughter told that he had (in
      all probability) been scored off again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course, I can excuse dear old Cholmondeliegh,&rdquo; said Beaumont, as he
      helped us off with our coats. &ldquo;He has not the modern mind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is the modern mind?&rdquo; asked Grant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, it's enlightened, you know, and progressive&mdash;and faces the facts
      of life seriously.&rdquo; At this moment another roar of laughter came from
      within.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I only ask,&rdquo; said Basil, &ldquo;because of the last two friends of yours who
      had the modern mind; one thought it wrong to eat fishes and the other
      thought it right to eat men. I beg your pardon&mdash;this way, if I
      remember right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know,&rdquo; said Lord Beaumont, with a sort of feverish entertainment,
      as he trotted after us towards the interior, &ldquo;I can never quite make out
      which side you are on. Sometimes you seem so liberal and sometimes so
      reactionary. Are you a modern, Basil?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Basil, loudly and cheerfully, as he entered the crowded
      drawing-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      This caused a slight diversion, and some eyes were turned away from our
      slim friend with the Oriental face for the first time that afternoon. Two
      people, however, still looked at him. One was the daughter of the house,
      Muriel Beaumont, who gazed at him with great violet eyes and with the
      intense and awful thirst of the female upper class for verbal amusement
      and stimulus. The other was Sir Walter Cholmondeliegh, who looked at him
      with a still and sullen but unmistakable desire to throw him out of the
      window.
    </p>
    <p>
      He sat there, coiled rather than seated on the easy chair; everything from
      the curves of his smooth limbs to the coils of his silvered hair
      suggesting the circles of a serpent more than the straight limbs of a man&mdash;the
      unmistakable, splendid serpentine gentleman we had seen walking in North
      London, his eyes shining with repeated victory.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What I can't understand, Mr Wimpole,&rdquo; said Muriel Beaumont eagerly, &ldquo;is
      how you contrive to treat all this so easily. You say things quite
      philosophical and yet so wildly funny. If I thought of such things, I'm
      sure I should laugh outright when the thought first came.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I agree with Miss Beaumont,&rdquo; said Sir Walter, suddenly exploding with
      indignation. &ldquo;If I had thought of anything so futile, I should find it
      difficult to keep my countenance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Difficult to keep your countenance,&rdquo; cried Mr Wimpole, with an air of
      alarm; &ldquo;oh, do keep your countenance! Keep it in the British Museum.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Every one laughed uproariously, as they always do at an already admitted
      readiness, and Sir Walter, turning suddenly purple, shouted out:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know who you are talking to, with your confounded tomfooleries?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never talk tomfooleries,&rdquo; said the other, &ldquo;without first knowing my
      audience.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Grant walked across the room and tapped the red-moustached secretary on
      the shoulder. That gentleman was leaning against the wall regarding the
      whole scene with a great deal of gloom; but, I fancied, with very
      particular gloom when his eyes fell on the young lady of the house
      rapturously listening to Wimpole.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May I have a word with you outside, Drummond?&rdquo; asked Grant. &ldquo;It is about
      business. Lady Beaumont will excuse us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I followed my friend, at his own request, greatly wondering, to this
      strange external interview. We passed abruptly into a kind of side room
      out of the hall.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Drummond,&rdquo; said Basil sharply, &ldquo;there are a great many good people, and a
      great many sane people here this afternoon. Unfortunately, by a kind of
      coincidence, all the good people are mad, and all the sane people are
      wicked. You are the only person I know of here who is honest and has also
      some common sense. What do you make of Wimpole?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr Secretary Drummond had a pale face and red hair; but at this his face
      became suddenly as red as his moustache.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not a fair judge of him,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; asked Grant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because I hate him like hell,&rdquo; said the other, after a long pause and
      violently.
    </p>
    <p>
      Neither Grant nor I needed to ask the reason; his glances towards Miss
      Beaumont and the stranger were sufficiently illuminating. Grant said
      quietly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But before&mdash;before you came to hate him, what did you really think
      of him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am in a terrible difficulty,&rdquo; said the young man, and his voice told
      us, like a clear bell, that he was an honest man. &ldquo;If I spoke about him as
      I feel about him now, I could not trust myself. And I should like to be
      able to say that when I first saw him I thought he was charming. But
      again, the fact is I didn't. I hate him, that is my private affair. But I
      also disapprove of him&mdash;really I do believe I disapprove of him quite
      apart from my private feelings. When first he came, I admit he was much
      quieter, but I did not like, so to speak, the moral swell of him. Then
      that jolly old Sir Walter Cholmondeliegh got introduced to us, and this
      fellow, with his cheap-jack wit, began to score off the old man in the way
      he does now. Then I felt that he must be a bad lot; it must be bad to
      fight the old and the kindly. And he fights the poor old chap savagely,
      unceasingly, as if he hated old age and kindliness. Take, if you want it,
      the evidence of a prejudiced witness. I admit that I hate the man because
      a certain person admires him. But I believe that apart from that I should
      hate the man because old Sir Walter hates him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This speech affected me with a genuine sense of esteem and pity for the
      young man; that is, of pity for him because of his obviously hopeless
      worship of Miss Beaumont, and of esteem for him because of the direct
      realistic account of the history of Wimpole which he had given. Still, I
      was sorry that he seemed so steadily set against the man, and could not
      help referring it to an instinct of his personal relations, however nobly
      disguised from himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the middle of these meditations, Grant whispered in my ear what was
      perhaps the most startling of all interruptions.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the name of God, let's get away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I have never known exactly in how odd a way this odd old man affected me.
      I only know that for some reason or other he so affected me that I was,
      within a few minutes, in the street outside.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;is a beastly but amusing affair.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is?&rdquo; I asked, baldly enough.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This affair. Listen to me, my old friend. Lord and Lady Beaumont have
      just invited you and me to a grand dinner-party this very night, at which
      Mr Wimpole will be in all his glory. Well, there is nothing very
      extraordinary about that. The extraordinary thing is that we are not
      going.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, really,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;it is already six o'clock and I doubt if we could
      get home and dress. I see nothing extraordinary in the fact that we are
      not going.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't you?&rdquo; said Grant. &ldquo;I'll bet you'll see something extraordinary in
      what we're doing instead.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I looked at him blankly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Doing instead?&rdquo; I asked. &ldquo;What are we doing instead?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;we are waiting for one or two hours outside this house on
      a winter evening. You must forgive me; it is all my vanity. It is only to
      show you that I am right. Can you, with the assistance of this cigar, wait
      until both Sir Walter Cholmondeliegh and the mystic Wimpole have left this
      house?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;But I do not know which is likely to leave first.
      Have you any notion?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Sir Walter may leave first in a glow of rage. Or again, Mr
      Wimpole may leave first, feeling that his last epigram is a thing to be
      flung behind him like a firework. And Sir Walter may remain some time to
      analyse Mr Wimpole's character. But they will both have to leave within
      reasonable time, for they will both have to get dressed and come back to
      dinner here tonight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As he spoke the shrill double whistle from the porch of the great house
      drew a dark cab to the dark portal. And then a thing happened that we
      really had not expected. Mr Wimpole and Sir Walter Cholmondeliegh came out
      at the same moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      They paused for a second or two opposite each other in a natural doubt;
      then a certain geniality, fundamental perhaps in both of them, made Sir
      Walter smile and say: &ldquo;The night is foggy. Pray take my cab.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Before I could count twenty the cab had gone rattling up the street with
      both of them. And before I could count twenty-three Grant had hissed in my
      ear:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Run after the cab; run as if you were running from a mad dog&mdash;run.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We pelted on steadily, keeping the cab in sight, through dark mazy
      streets. God only, I thought, knows why we are running at all, but we are
      running hard. Fortunately we did not run far. The cab pulled up at the
      fork of two streets and Sir Walter paid the cabman, who drove away
      rejoicing, having just come in contact with the more generous among the
      rich. Then the two men talked together as men do talk together after
      giving and receiving great insults, the talk which leads either to
      forgiveness or a duel&mdash;at least so it seemed as we watched it from
      ten yards off. Then the two men shook hands heartily, and one went down
      one fork of the road and one down another.
    </p>
    <p>
      Basil, with one of his rare gestures, flung his arms forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Run after that scoundrel,&rdquo; he cried; &ldquo;let us catch him now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We dashed across the open space and reached the juncture of two paths.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stop!&rdquo; I shouted wildly to Grant. &ldquo;That's the wrong turning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He ran on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Idiot!&rdquo; I howled. &ldquo;Sir Walter's gone down there. Wimpole has slipped us.
      He's half a mile down the other road. You're wrong... Are you deaf? You're
      wrong!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't think I am,&rdquo; he panted, and ran on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I saw him!&rdquo; I cried. &ldquo;Look in front of you. Is that Wimpole? It's the
      old man... What are you doing? What are we to do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Keep running,&rdquo; said Grant.
    </p>
    <p>
      Running soon brought us up to the broad back of the pompous old baronet,
      whose white whiskers shone silver in the fitful lamplight. My brain was
      utterly bewildered. I grasped nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Charlie,&rdquo; said Basil hoarsely, &ldquo;can you believe in my common sense for
      four minutes?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; I said, panting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then help me to catch that man in front and hold him down. Do it at once
      when I say 'Now'. Now!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We sprang on Sir Walter Cholmondeliegh, and rolled that portly old
      gentleman on his back. He fought with a commendable valour, but we got him
      tight. I had not the remotest notion why. He had a splendid and
      full-blooded vigour; when he could not box he kicked, and we bound him;
      when he could not kick he shouted, and we gagged him. Then, by Basil's
      arrangement, we dragged him into a small court by the street side and
      waited. As I say, I had no notion why.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sorry to incommode you,&rdquo; said Basil calmly out of the darkness; &ldquo;but
      I have made an appointment here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An appointment!&rdquo; I said blankly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said, glancing calmly at the apoplectic old aristocrat gagged on
      the ground, whose eyes were starting impotently from his head. &ldquo;I have
      made an appointment here with a thoroughly nice young fellow. An old
      friend. Jasper Drummond his name is&mdash;you may have met him this
      afternoon at the Beaumonts. He can scarcely come though till the
      Beaumonts' dinner is over.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For I do not know how many hours we stood there calmly in the darkness. By
      the time those hours were over I had thoroughly made up my mind that the
      same thing had happened which had happened long ago on the bench of a
      British Court of Justice. Basil Grant had gone mad. I could imagine no
      other explanation of the facts, with the portly, purple-faced old country
      gentleman flung there strangled on the floor like a bundle of wood.
    </p>
    <p>
      After about four hours a lean figure in evening dress rushed into the
      court. A glimpse of gaslight showed the red moustache and white face of
      Jasper Drummond.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr Grant,&rdquo; he said blankly, &ldquo;the thing is incredible. You were right; but
      what did you mean? All through this dinner-party, where dukes and
      duchesses and editors of Quarterlies had come especially to hear him, that
      extraordinary Wimpole kept perfectly silent. He didn't say a funny thing.
      He didn't say anything at all. What does it mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Grant pointed to the portly old gentleman on the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is what it means,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Drummond, on observing a fat gentleman lying so calmly about the place,
      jumped back, as from a mouse.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What?&rdquo; he said weakly, &ldquo;... what?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Basil bent suddenly down and tore a paper out of Sir Walter's
      breastpocket, a paper which the baronet, even in his hampered state,
      seemed to make some effort to retain.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a large loose piece of white wrapping paper, which Mr Jasper
      Drummond read with a vacant eye and undisguised astonishment. As far as he
      could make out, it consisted of a series of questions and answers, or at
      least of remarks and replies, arranged in the manner of a catechism. The
      greater part of the document had been torn and obliterated in the
      struggle, but the termination remained. It ran as follows:
    </p>
    <p>
      C. Says... Keep countenance.
    </p>
    <p>
      W. Keep... British Museum.
    </p>
    <p>
      C. Know whom talk... absurdities.
    </p>
    <p>
      W. Never talk absurdities without
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; cried Drummond, flinging the paper down in a sort of final
      fury.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; replied Grant, his voice rising into a kind of splendid
      chant. &ldquo;What is it? It is a great new profession. A great new trade. A
      trifle immoral, I admit, but still great, like piracy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A new profession!&rdquo; said the young man with the red moustache vaguely; &ldquo;a
      new trade!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A new trade,&rdquo; repeated Grant, with a strange exultation, &ldquo;a new
      profession! What a pity it is immoral.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what the deuce is it?&rdquo; cried Drummond and I in a breath of blasphemy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is,&rdquo; said Grant calmly, &ldquo;the great new trade of the Organizer of
      Repartee. This fat old gentleman lying on the ground strikes you, as I
      have no doubt, as very stupid and very rich. Let me clear his character.
      He is, like ourselves, very clever and very poor. He is also not really at
      all fat; all that is stuffing. He is not particularly old, and his name is
      not Cholmondeliegh. He is a swindler, and a swindler of a perfectly
      delightful and novel kind. He hires himself out at dinner-parties to lead
      up to other people's repartees. According to a preconcerted scheme (which
      you may find on that piece of paper), he says the stupid things he has
      arranged for himself, and his client says the clever things arranged for
      him. In short, he allows himself to be scored off for a guinea a night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And this fellow Wimpole&mdash;&rdquo; began Drummond with indignation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This fellow Wimpole,&rdquo; said Basil Grant, smiling, &ldquo;will not be an
      intellectual rival in the future. He had some fine things, elegance and
      silvered hair, and so on. But the intellect is with our friend on the
      floor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That fellow,&rdquo; cried Drummond furiously, &ldquo;that fellow ought to be in
      gaol.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not at all,&rdquo; said Basil indulgently; &ldquo;he ought to be in the Club of Queer
      Trades.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      Chapter 3. The Awful Reason of the Vicar's Visit
    </h2>
    <p>
      The revolt of Matter against Man (which I believe to exist) has now been
      reduced to a singular condition. It is the small things rather than the
      large things which make war against us and, I may add, beat us. The bones
      of the last mammoth have long ago decayed, a mighty wreck; the tempests no
      longer devour our navies, nor the mountains with hearts of fire heap hell
      over our cities. But we are engaged in a bitter and eternal war with small
      things; chiefly with microbes and with collar studs. The stud with which I
      was engaged (on fierce and equal terms) as I made the above reflections,
      was one which I was trying to introduce into my shirt collar when a loud
      knock came at the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      My first thought was as to whether Basil Grant had called to fetch me. He
      and I were to turn up at the same dinner-party (for which I was in the act
      of dressing), and it might be that he had taken it into his head to come
      my way, though we had arranged to go separately. It was a small and
      confidential affair at the table of a good but unconventional political
      lady, an old friend of his. She had asked us both to meet a third guest, a
      Captain Fraser, who had made something of a name and was an authority on
      chimpanzees. As Basil was an old friend of the hostess and I had never
      seen her, I felt that it was quite possible that he (with his usual social
      sagacity) might have decided to take me along in order to break the ice.
      The theory, like all my theories, was complete; but as a fact it was not
      Basil.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was handed a visiting card inscribed: &ldquo;Rev. Ellis Shorter&rdquo;, and
      underneath was written in pencil, but in a hand in which even hurry could
      not conceal a depressing and gentlemanly excellence, &ldquo;Asking the favour of
      a few moments' conversation on a most urgent matter.&rdquo;!
    </p>
    <p>
      I had already subdued the stud, thereby proclaiming that the image of God
      has supremacy over all matters (a valuable truth), and throwing on my
      dress-coat and waistcoat, hurried into the drawing-room. He rose at my
      entrance, flapping like a seal; I can use no other description. He flapped
      a plaid shawl over his right arm; he flapped a pair of pathetic black
      gloves; he flapped his clothes; I may say, without exaggeration, that he
      flapped his eyelids, as he rose. He was a bald-browed, white-haired,
      white-whiskered old clergyman, of a flappy and floppy type. He said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am so sorry. I am so very sorry. I am so extremely sorry. I come&mdash;I
      can only say&mdash;I can only say in my defence, that I come&mdash;upon an
      important matter. Pray forgive me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I told him I forgave perfectly and waited.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What I have to say,&rdquo; he said brokenly, &ldquo;is so dreadful&mdash;it is so
      dreadful&mdash;I have lived a quiet life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I was burning to get away, for it was already doubtful if I should be in
      time for dinner. But there was something about the old man's honest air of
      bitterness that seemed to open to me the possibilities of life larger and
      more tragic than my own.
    </p>
    <p>
      I said gently: &ldquo;Pray go on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nevertheless the old gentleman, being a gentleman as well as old, noticed
      my secret impatience and seemed still more unmanned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm so sorry,&rdquo; he said meekly; &ldquo;I wouldn't have come&mdash;but for&mdash;your
      friend Major Brown recommended me to come here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Major Brown!&rdquo; I said, with some interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the Reverend Mr Shorter, feverishly flapping his plaid shawl
      about. &ldquo;He told me you helped him in a great difficulty&mdash;and my
      difficulty! Oh, my dear sir, it's a matter of life and death.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I rose abruptly, in an acute perplexity. &ldquo;Will it take long, Mr Shorter?&rdquo;
       I asked. &ldquo;I have to go out to dinner almost at once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He rose also, trembling from head to foot, and yet somehow, with all his
      moral palsy, he rose to the dignity of his age and his office.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have no right, Mr Swinburne&mdash;I have no right at all,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;If
      you have to go out to dinner, you have of course&mdash;a perfect right&mdash;of
      course a perfect right. But when you come back&mdash;a man will be dead.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And he sat down, quaking like a jelly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The triviality of the dinner had been in those two minutes dwarfed and
      drowned in my mind. I did not want to go and see a political widow, and a
      captain who collected apes; I wanted to hear what had brought this dear,
      doddering old vicar into relation with immediate perils.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you have a cigar?&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, thank you,&rdquo; he said, with indescribable embarrassment, as if not
      smoking cigars was a social disgrace.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A glass of wine?&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, thank you, no, thank you; not just now,&rdquo; he repeated with that
      hysterical eagerness with which people who do not drink at all often try
      to convey that on any other night of the week they would sit up all night
      drinking rum-punch. &ldquo;Not just now, thank you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing else I can get for you?&rdquo; I said, feeling genuinely sorry for the
      well-mannered old donkey. &ldquo;A cup of tea?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I saw a struggle in his eye and I conquered. When the cup of tea came he
      drank it like a dipsomaniac gulping brandy. Then he fell back and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have had such a time, Mr Swinburne. I am not used to these excitements.
      As Vicar of Chuntsey, in Essex'&mdash;he threw this in with an
      indescribable airiness of vanity&mdash;'I have never known such things
      happen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What things happen?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      He straightened himself with sudden dignity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As Vicar of Chuntsey, in Essex,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I have never been forcibly
      dressed up as an old woman and made to take part in a crime in the
      character of an old woman. Never once. My experience may be small. It may
      be insufficient. But it has never occurred to me before.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have never heard of it,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;as among the duties of a clergyman.
      But I am not well up in church matters. Excuse me if perhaps I failed to
      follow you correctly. Dressed up&mdash;as what?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As an old woman,&rdquo; said the vicar solemnly, &ldquo;as an old woman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I thought in my heart that it required no great transformation to make an
      old woman of him, but the thing was evidently more tragic than comic, and
      I said respectfully:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May I ask how it occurred?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will begin at the beginning,&rdquo; said Mr Shorter, &ldquo;and I will tell my
      story with the utmost possible precision. At seventeen minutes past eleven
      this morning I left the vicarage to keep certain appointments and pay
      certain visits in the village. My first visit was to Mr Jervis, the
      treasurer of our League of Christian Amusements, with whom I concluded
      some business touching the claim made by Parkes the gardener in the matter
      of the rolling of our tennis lawn. I then visited Mrs Arnett, a very
      earnest churchwoman, but permanently bedridden. She is the author of
      several small works of devotion, and of a book of verse, entitled (unless
      my memory misleads me) Eglantine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He uttered all this not only with deliberation, but with something that
      can only be called, by a contradictory phrase, eager deliberation. He had,
      I think, a vague memory in his head of the detectives in the detective
      stories, who always sternly require that nothing should be kept back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I then proceeded,&rdquo; he went on, with the same maddening conscientiousness
      of manner, &ldquo;to Mr Carr (not Mr James Carr, of course; Mr Robert Carr) who
      is temporarily assisting our organist, and having consulted with him (on
      the subject of a choir boy who is accused, I cannot as yet say whether
      justly or not, of cutting holes in the organ pipes), I finally dropped in
      upon a Dorcas meeting at the house of Miss Brett. The Dorcas meetings are
      usually held at the vicarage, but my wife being unwell, Miss Brett, a
      newcomer in our village, but very active in church work, had very kindly
      consented to hold them. The Dorcas society is entirely under my wife's
      management as a rule, and except for Miss Brett, who, as I say, is very
      active, I scarcely know any members of it. I had, however, promised to
      drop in on them, and I did so.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When I arrived there were only four other maiden ladies with Miss Brett,
      but they were sewing very busily. It is very difficult, of course, for any
      person, however strongly impressed with the necessity in these matters of
      full and exact exposition of the facts, to remember and repeat the actual
      details of a conversation, particularly a conversation which (though
      inspired with a most worthy and admirable zeal for good work) was one
      which did not greatly impress the hearer's mind at the time and was in
      fact&mdash;er&mdash;mostly about socks. I can, however, remember
      distinctly that one of the spinster ladies (she was a thin person with a
      woollen shawl, who appeared to feel the cold, and I am almost sure she was
      introduced to me as Miss James) remarked that the weather was very
      changeable. Miss Brett then offered me a cup of tea, which I accepted, I
      cannot recall in what words. Miss Brett is a short and stout lady with
      white hair. The only other figure in the group that caught my attention
      was a Miss Mowbray, a small and neat lady of aristocratic manners, silver
      hair, and a high voice and colour. She was the most emphatic member of the
      party; and her views on the subject of pinafores, though expressed with a
      natural deference to myself, were in themselves strong and advanced.
      Beside her (although all five ladies were dressed simply in black) it
      could not be denied that the others looked in some way what you men of the
      world would call dowdy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;After about ten minutes' conversation I rose to go, and as I did so I
      heard something which&mdash;I cannot describe it&mdash;something which
      seemed to&mdash;but I really cannot describe it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did you hear?&rdquo; I asked, with some impatience.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I heard,&rdquo; said the vicar solemnly, &ldquo;I heard Miss Mowbray (the lady with
      the silver hair) say to Miss James (the lady with the woollen shawl), the
      following extraordinary words. I committed them to memory on the spot, and
      as soon as circumstances set me free to do so, I noted them down on a
      piece of paper. I believe I have it here.&rdquo; He fumbled in his
      breast-pocket, bringing out mild things, note-books, circulars and
      programmes of village concerts. &ldquo;I heard Miss Mowbray say to Miss James,
      the following words: 'Now's your time, Bill.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He gazed at me for a few moments after making this announcement, gravely
      and unflinchingly, as if conscious that here he was unshaken about his
      facts. Then he resumed, turning his bald head more towards the fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This appeared to me remarkable. I could not by any means understand it.
      It seemed to me first of all peculiar that one maiden lady should address
      another maiden lady as 'Bill'. My experience, as I have said, may be
      incomplete; maiden ladies may have among themselves and in exclusively
      spinster circles wilder customs than I am aware of. But it seemed to me
      odd, and I could almost have sworn (if you will not misunderstand the
      phrase), I should have been strongly impelled to maintain at the time that
      the words, 'Now's your time, Bill', were by no means pronounced with that
      upper-class intonation which, as I have already said, had up to now
      characterized Miss Mowbray's conversation. In fact, the words, 'Now's your
      time, Bill', would have been, I fancy, unsuitable if pronounced with that
      upper-class intonation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was surprised, I repeat, then, at the remark. But I was still more
      surprised when, looking round me in bewilderment, my hat and umbrella in
      hand, I saw the lean lady with the woollen shawl leaning upright against
      the door out of which I was just about to make my exit. She was still
      knitting, and I supposed that this erect posture against the door was only
      an eccentricity of spinsterhood and an oblivion of my intended departure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I said genially, 'I am so sorry to disturb you, Miss James, but I must
      really be going. I have&mdash;er&mdash;' I stopped here, for the words she
      had uttered in reply, though singularly brief and in tone extremely
      business-like, were such as to render that arrest of my remarks, I think,
      natural and excusable. I have these words also noted down. I have not the
      least idea of their meaning; so I have only been able to render them
      phonetically. But she said,&rdquo; and Mr Shorter peered short-sightedly at his
      papers, &ldquo;she said: 'Chuck it, fat 'ead,' and she added something that
      sounded like 'It's a kop', or (possibly) 'a kopt'. And then the last cord,
      either of my sanity or the sanity of the universe, snapped suddenly. My
      esteemed friend and helper, Miss Brett, standing by the mantelpiece, said:
      'Put 'is old 'ead in a bag, Sam, and tie 'im up before you start jawin'.
      You'll be kopt yourselves some o' these days with this way of coin'
      things, har lar theater.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My head went round and round. Was it really true, as I had suddenly
      fancied a moment before, that unmarried ladies had some dreadful riotous
      society of their own from which all others were excluded? I remembered
      dimly in my classical days (I was a scholar in a small way once, but now,
      alas! rusty), I remembered the mysteries of the Bona Dea and their strange
      female freemasonry. I remembered the witches' Sabbaths. I was just, in my
      absurd lightheadedness, trying to remember a line of verse about Diana's
      nymphs, when Miss Mowbray threw her arm round me from behind. The moment
      it held me I knew it was not a woman's arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Brett&mdash;or what I had called Miss Brett&mdash;was standing in
      front of me with a big revolver in her hand and a broad grin on her face.
      Miss James was still leaning against the door, but had fallen into an
      attitude so totally new, and so totally unfeminine, that it gave one a
      shock. She was kicking her heels, with her hands in her pockets and her
      cap on one side. She was a man. I mean he was a wo&mdash;no, that is I saw
      that instead of being a woman she&mdash;he, I mean&mdash;that is, it was a
      man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr Shorter became indescribably flurried and flapping in endeavouring to
      arrange these genders and his plaid shawl at the same time. He resumed
      with a higher fever of nervousness:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As for Miss Mowbray, she&mdash;he, held me in a ring of iron. He had her
      arm&mdash;that is she had his arm&mdash;round her neck&mdash;my neck I
      mean&mdash;and I could not cry out. Miss Brett&mdash;that is, Mr Brett, at
      least Mr something who was not Miss Brett&mdash;had the revolver pointed
      at me. The other two ladies&mdash;or er&mdash;gentlemen, were rummaging in
      some bag in the background. It was all clear at last: they were criminals
      dressed up as women, to kidnap me! To kidnap the Vicar of Chuntsey, in
      Essex. But why? Was it to be Nonconformists?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The brute leaning against the door called out carelessly, ''Urry up,
      'Arry. Show the old bloke what the game is, and let's get off.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Curse 'is eyes,' said Miss Brett&mdash;I mean the man with the revolver&mdash;'why
      should we show 'im the game?'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'If you take my advice you bloomin' well will,' said the man at the door,
      whom they called Bill. 'A man wot knows wet 'e's doin' is worth ten wot
      don't, even if 'e's a potty old parson.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Bill's right enough,' said the coarse voice of the man who held me (it
      had been Miss Mowbray's). 'Bring out the picture, 'Arry.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The man with the revolver walked across the room to where the other two
      women&mdash;I mean men&mdash;were turning over baggage, and asked them for
      something which they gave him. He came back with it across the room and
      held it out in front of me. And compared to the surprise of that display,
      all the previous surprises of this awful day shrank suddenly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was a portrait of myself. That such a picture should be in the hands
      of these scoundrels might in any case have caused a mild surprise; but no
      more. It was no mild surprise that I felt. The likeness was an extremely
      good one, worked up with all the accessories of the conventional
      photographic studio. I was leaning my head on my hand and was relieved
      against a painted landscape of woodland. It was obvious that it was no
      snapshot; it was clear that I had sat for this photograph. And the truth
      was that I had never sat for such a photograph. It was a photograph that I
      had never had taken.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I stared at it again and again. It seemed to me to be touched up a good
      deal; it was glazed as well as framed, and the glass blurred some of the
      details. But there unmistakably was my face, my eyes, my nose and mouth,
      my head and hand, posed for a professional photographer. And I had never
      posed so for any photographer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Be'old the bloomin' miracle,' said the man with the revolver, with
      ill-timed facetiousness. 'Parson, prepare to meet your God.' And with this
      he slid the glass out of the frame. As the glass moved, I saw that part of
      the picture was painted on it in Chinese white, notably a pair of white
      whiskers and a clerical collar. And underneath was a portrait of an old
      lady in a quiet black dress, leaning her head on her hand against the
      woodland landscape. The old lady was as like me as one pin is like
      another. It had required only the whiskers and the collar to make it me in
      every hair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Entertainin', ain't it?' said the man described as 'Arry, as he shot the
      glass back again. 'Remarkable resemblance, parson. Gratifyin' to the lady.
      Gratifyin' to you. And hi may hadd, particlery gratifyin' to us, as bein'
      the probable source of a very tolerable haul. You know Colonel Hawker, the
      man who's come to live in these parts, don't you?'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Well,' said the man 'Arry, pointing to the picture, 'that's 'is mother.
      'Oo ran to catch 'im when 'e fell? She did,' and he flung his fingers in a
      general gesture towards the photograph of the old lady who was exactly
      like me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Tell the old gent wot 'e's got to do and be done with it,' broke out
      Bill from the door. 'Look 'ere, Reverend Shorter, we ain't goin' to do you
      no 'arm. We'll give you a sov. for your trouble if you like. And as for
      the old woman's clothes&mdash;why, you'll look lovely in 'em.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'You ain't much of a 'and at a description, Bill,' said the man behind
      me. 'Mr Shorter, it's like this. We've got to see this man Hawker tonight.
      Maybe 'e'll kiss us all and 'ave up the champagne when 'e sees us. Maybe
      on the other 'and&mdash;'e won't. Maybe 'e'll be dead when we goes away.
      Maybe not. But we've got to see 'im. Now as you know, 'e shuts 'isself up
      and never opens the door to a soul; only you don't know why and we does.
      The only one as can ever get at 'im is 'is mother. Well, it's a confounded
      funny coincidence,' he said, accenting the penultimate, 'it's a very
      unusual piece of good luck, but you're 'is mother.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'When first I saw 'er picture,' said the man Bill, shaking his head in a
      ruminant manner, 'when I first saw it I said&mdash;old Shorter. Those were
      my exact words&mdash;old Shorter.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'What do you mean, you wild creatures?' I gasped. 'What am I to do?'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'That's easy said, your 'oldness,' said the man with the revolver,
      good-humouredly; 'you've got to put on those clothes,' and he pointed to a
      poke-bonnet and a heap of female clothes in the corner of the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will not dwell, Mr Swinburne, upon the details of what followed. I had
      no choice. I could not fight five men, to say nothing of a loaded pistol.
      In five minutes, sir, the Vicar of Chuntsey was dressed as an old woman&mdash;as
      somebody else's mother, if you please&mdash;and was dragged out of the
      house to take part in a crime.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was already late in the afternoon, and the nights of winter were
      closing in fast. On a dark road, in a blowing wind, we set out towards the
      lonely house of Colonel Hawker, perhaps the queerest cortege that ever
      straggled up that or any other road. To every human eye, in every
      external, we were six very respectable old ladies of small means, in black
      dresses and refined but antiquated bonnets; and we were really five
      criminals and a clergyman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will cut a long story short. My brain was whirling like a windmill as I
      walked, trying to think of some manner of escape. To cry out, so long as
      we were far from houses, would be suicidal, for it would be easy for the
      ruffians to knife me or to gag me and fling me into a ditch. On the other
      hand, to attempt to stop strangers and explain the situation was
      impossible, because of the frantic folly of the situation itself. Long
      before I had persuaded the chance postman or carrier of so absurd a story,
      my companions would certainly have got off themselves, and in all
      probability would have carried me off, as a friend of theirs who had the
      misfortune to be mad or drunk. The last thought, however, was an
      inspiration; though a very terrible one. Had it come to this, that the
      Vicar of Chuntsey must pretend to be mad or drunk? It had come to this.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I walked along with the rest up the deserted road, imitating and keeping
      pace, as far as I could, with their rapid and yet lady-like step, until at
      length I saw a lamp-post and a policeman standing under it. I had made up
      my mind. Until we reached them we were all equally demure and silent and
      swift. When we reached them I suddenly flung myself against the railings
      and roared out: 'Hooray! Hooray! Hooray! Rule Britannia! Get your 'air
      cut. Hoop-la! Boo!' It was a condition of no little novelty for a man in
      my position.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The constable instantly flashed his lantern on me, or the draggled,
      drunken old woman that was my travesty. 'Now then, mum,' he began gruffly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Come along quiet, or I'll eat your heart,' cried Sam in my ear hoarsely.
      'Stop, or I'll flay you.' It was frightful to hear the words and see the
      neatly shawled old spinster who whispered them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I yelled, and yelled&mdash;I was in for it now. I screamed comic refrains
      that vulgar young men had sung, to my regret, at our village concerts; I
      rolled to and fro like a ninepin about to fall.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'If you can't get your friend on quiet, ladies,' said the policeman, 'I
      shall have to take 'er up. Drunk and disorderly she is right enough.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I redoubled my efforts. I had not been brought up to this sort of thing;
      but I believe I eclipsed myself. Words that I did not know I had ever
      heard of seemed to come pouring out of my open mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'When we get you past,' whispered Bill, 'you'll howl louder; you'll howl
      louder when we're burning your feet off.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I screamed in my terror those awful songs of joy. In all the nightmares
      that men have ever dreamed, there has never been anything so blighting and
      horrible as the faces of those five men, looking out of their
      poke-bonnets; the figures of district visitors with the faces of devils. I
      cannot think there is anything so heart-breaking in hell.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For a sickening instant I thought that the bustle of my companions and
      the perfect respectability of all our dresses would overcome the policeman
      and induce him to let us pass. He wavered, so far as one can describe
      anything so solid as a policeman as wavering. I lurched suddenly forward
      and ran my head into his chest, calling out (if I remember correctly),
      'Oh, crikey, blimey, Bill.' It was at that moment that I remembered most
      dearly that I was the Vicar of Chuntsey, in Essex.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My desperate coup saved me. The policeman had me hard by the back of the
      neck.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'You come along with me,' he began, but Bill cut in with his perfect
      imitation of a lady's finnicking voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Oh, pray, constable, don't make a disturbance with our poor friend. We
      will get her quietly home. She does drink too much, but she is quite a
      lady&mdash;only eccentric.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'She butted me in the stomach,' said the policeman briefly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Eccentricities of genius,' said Sam earnestly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Pray let me take her home,' reiterated Bill, in the resumed character of
      Miss James, 'she wants looking after.' 'She does,' said the policeman,
      'but I'll look after her.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'That's no good,' cried Bill feverishly. 'She wants her friends. She
      wants a particular medicine we've got.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Yes,' assented Miss Mowbray, with excitement, 'no other medicine any
      good, constable. Complaint quite unique.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'I'm all righ'. Cutchy, cutchy, coo!' remarked, to his eternal shame, the
      Vicar of Chuntsey.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Look here, ladies,' said the constable sternly, 'I don't like the
      eccentricity of your friend, and I don't like 'er songs, or 'er 'ead in my
      stomach. And now I come to think of it, I don't like the looks of you I've
      seen many as quiet dressed as you as was wrong 'uns. Who are you?'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'We've not our cards with us,' said Miss Mowbray, with indescribable
      dignity. 'Nor do we see why we should be insulted by any Jack-in-office
      who chooses to be rude to ladies, when he is paid to protect them. If you
      choose to take advantage of the weakness of our unfortunate friend, no
      doubt you are legally entitled to take her. But if you fancy you have any
      legal right to bully us, you will find yourself in the wrong box.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The truth and dignity of this staggered the policeman for a moment. Under
      cover of their advantage my five persecutors turned for an instant on me
      faces like faces of the damned and then swished off into the darkness.
      When the constable first turned his lantern and his suspicions on to them,
      I had seen the telegraphic look flash from face to face saying that only
      retreat was possible now.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By this time I was sinking slowly to the pavement, in a state of acute
      reflection. So long as the ruffians were with me, I dared not quit the
      role of drunkard. For if I had begun to talk reasonably and explain the
      real case, the officer would merely have thought that I was slightly
      recovered and would have put me in charge of my friends. Now, however, if
      I liked I might safely undeceive him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I confess I did not like. The chances of life are many, and it may
      doubtless sometimes lie in the narrow path of duty for a clergyman of the
      Church of England to pretend to be a drunken old woman; but such
      necessities are, I imagine, sufficiently rare to appear to many
      improbable. Suppose the story got about that I had pretended to be drunk.
      Suppose people did not all think it was pretence!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I lurched up, the policeman half-lifting me. I went along weakly and
      quietly for about a hundred yards. The officer evidently thought that I
      was too sleepy and feeble to effect an escape, and so held me lightly and
      easily enough. Past one turning, two turnings, three turnings, four
      turnings, he trailed me with him, a limp and slow and reluctant figure. At
      the fourth turning, I suddenly broke from his hand and tore down the
      street like a maddened stag. He was unprepared, he was heavy, and it was
      dark. I ran and ran and ran, and in five minutes' running, found I was
      gaining. In half an hour I was out in the fields under the holy and
      blessed stars, where I tore off my accursed shawl and bonnet and buried
      them in clean earth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The old gentleman had finished his story and leant back in his chair. Both
      the matter and the manner of his narration had, as time went on, impressed
      me favourably. He was an old duffer and pedant, but behind these things he
      was a country-bred man and gentleman, and had showed courage and a
      sporting instinct in the hour of desperation. He had told his story with
      many quaint formalities of diction, but also with a very convincing
      realism.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now&mdash;&rdquo; I began.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now,&rdquo; said Shorter, leaning forward again with something like servile
      energy, &ldquo;and now, Mr Swinburne, what about that unhappy man Hawker. I
      cannot tell what those men meant, or how far what they said was real. But
      surely there is danger. I cannot go to the police, for reasons that you
      perceive. Among other things, they wouldn't believe me. What is to be
      done?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I took out my watch. It was already half past twelve.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My friend Basil Grant,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;is the best man we can go to. He and I
      were to have gone to the same dinner tonight; but he will just have come
      back by now. Have you any objection to taking a cab?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not at all,&rdquo; he replied, rising politely, and gathering up his absurd
      plaid shawl.
    </p>
    <p>
      A rattle in a hansom brought us underneath the sombre pile of workmen's
      flats in Lambeth which Grant inhabited; a climb up a wearisome wooden
      staircase brought us to his garret. When I entered that wooden and scrappy
      interior, the white gleam of Basil's shirt-front and the lustre of his fur
      coat flung on the wooden settle, struck me as a contrast. He was drinking
      a glass of wine before retiring. I was right; he had come back from the
      dinner-party.
    </p>
    <p>
      He listened to the repetition of the story of the Rev. Ellis Shorter with
      the genuine simplicity and respect which he never failed to exhibit in
      dealing with any human being. When it was over he said simply:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know a man named Captain Fraser?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I was so startled at this totally irrelevant reference to the worthy
      collector of chimpanzees with whom I ought to have dined that evening,
      that I glanced sharply at Grant. The result was that I did not look at Mr
      Shorter. I only heard him answer, in his most nervous tone, &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Basil, however, seemed to find something very curious about his answer or
      his demeanour generally, for he kept his big blue eyes fixed on the old
      clergyman, and though the eyes were quite quiet they stood out more and
      more from his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are quite sure, Mr Shorter,&rdquo; he repeated, &ldquo;that you don't know
      Captain Fraser?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite,&rdquo; answered the vicar, and I was certainly puzzled to find him
      returning so much to the timidity, not to say the demoralization, of his
      tone when he first entered my presence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Basil sprang smartly to his feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then our course is clear,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You have not even begun your
      investigation, my dear Mr Shorter; the first thing for us to do is to go
      together to see Captain Fraser.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When?&rdquo; asked the clergyman, stammering.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said Basil, putting one arm in his fur coat.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old clergyman rose to his feet, quaking all over.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I really do not think that it is necessary,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Basil took his arm out of the fur coat, threw it over the chair again, and
      put his hands in his pockets.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; he said, with emphasis. &ldquo;Oh&mdash;you don't think it necessary;
      then,&rdquo; and he added the words with great clearness and deliberation,
      &ldquo;then, Mr Ellis Shorter, I can only say that I would like to see you
      without your whiskers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And at these words I also rose to my feet, for the great tragedy of my
      life had come. Splendid and exciting as life was in continual contact with
      an intellect like Basil's, I had always the feeling that that splendour
      and excitement were on the borderland of sanity. He lived perpetually near
      the vision of the reason of things which makes men lose their reason. And
      I felt of his insanity as men feel of the death of friends with heart
      disease. It might come anywhere, in a field, in a hansom cab, looking at a
      sunset, smoking a cigarette. It had come now. At the very moment of
      delivering a judgement for the salvation of a fellow creature, Basil Grant
      had gone mad.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your whiskers,&rdquo; he cried, advancing with blazing eyes. &ldquo;Give me your
      whiskers. And your bald head.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The old vicar naturally retreated a step or two. I stepped between.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sit down, Basil,&rdquo; I implored, &ldquo;you're a little excited. Finish your
      wine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whiskers,&rdquo; he answered sternly, &ldquo;whiskers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And with that he made a dash at the old gentleman, who made a dash for the
      door, but was intercepted. And then, before I knew where I was the quiet
      room was turned into something between a pantomime and a pandemonium by
      those two. Chairs were flung over with a crash, tables were vaulted with a
      noise like thunder, screens were smashed, crockery scattered in
      smithereens, and still Basil Grant bounded and bellowed after the Rev.
      Ellis Shorter.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now I began to perceive something else, which added the last
      half-witted touch to my mystification. The Rev. Ellis Shorter, of
      Chuntsey, in Essex, was by no means behaving as I had previously noticed
      him to behave, or as, considering his age and station, I should have
      expected him to behave. His power of dodging, leaping, and fighting would
      have been amazing in a lad of seventeen, and in this doddering old vicar
      looked like a sort of farcical fairy-tale. Moreover, he did not seem to be
      so much astonished as I had thought. There was even a look of something
      like enjoyment in his eyes; so there was in the eye of Basil. In fact, the
      unintelligible truth must be told. They were both laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length Shorter was cornered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, come, Mr Grant,&rdquo; he panted, &ldquo;you can't do anything to me. It's
      quite legal. And it doesn't do any one the least harm. It's only a social
      fiction. A result of our complex society, Mr Grant.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't blame you, my man,&rdquo; said Basil coolly. &ldquo;But I want your whiskers.
      And your bald head. Do they belong to Captain Fraser?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; said Mr Shorter, laughing, &ldquo;we provide them ourselves. They
      don't belong to Captain Fraser.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What the deuce does all this mean?&rdquo; I almost screamed. &ldquo;Are you all in an
      infernal nightmare? Why should Mr Shorter's bald head belong to Captain
      Fraser? How could it? What the deuce has Captain Fraser to do with the
      affair? What is the matter with him? You dined with him, Basil.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Grant, &ldquo;I didn't.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Didn't you go to Mrs Thornton's dinner-party?&rdquo; I asked, staring. &ldquo;Why
      not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Basil, with a slow and singular smile, &ldquo;the fact is I was
      detained by a visitor. I have him, as a point of fact, in my bedroom.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In your bedroom?&rdquo; I repeated; but my imagination had reached that point
      when he might have said in his coal scuttle or his waistcoat pocket.
    </p>
    <p>
      Grant stepped to the door of an inner room, flung it open and walked in.
      Then he came out again with the last of the bodily wonders of that wild
      night. He introduced into the sitting-room, in an apologetic manner, and
      by the nape of the neck, a limp clergyman with a bald head, white whiskers
      and a plaid shawl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sit down, gentlemen,&rdquo; cried Grant, striking his hands heartily. &ldquo;Sit down
      all of you and have a glass of wine. As you say, there is no harm in it,
      and if Captain Fraser had simply dropped me a hint I could have saved him
      from dropping a good sum of money. Not that you would have liked that,
      eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The two duplicate clergymen, who were sipping their Burgundy with two
      duplicate grins, laughed heartily at this, and one of them carelessly
      pulled off his whiskers and laid them on the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Basil,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;if you are my friend, save me. What is all this?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He laughed again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only another addition, Cherub, to your collection of Queer Trades. These
      two gentlemen (whose health I have now the pleasure of drinking) are
      Professional Detainers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what on earth's that?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's really very simple, Mr Swinburne,&rdquo; began he who had once been the
      Rev. Ellis Shorter, of Chuntsey, in Essex; and it gave me a shock
      indescribable to hear out of that pompous and familiar form come no longer
      its own pompous and familiar voice, but the brisk sharp tones of a young
      city man. &ldquo;It is really nothing very important. We are paid by our clients
      to detain in conversation, on some harmless pretext, people whom they want
      out of the way for a few hours. And Captain Fraser&mdash;&rdquo; and with that
      he hesitated and smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      Basil smiled also. He intervened.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The fact is that Captain Fraser, who is one of my best friends, wanted us
      both out of the way very much. He is sailing tonight for East Africa, and
      the lady with whom we were all to have dined is&mdash;er&mdash;what is I
      believe described as 'the romance of his life'. He wanted that two hours
      with her, and employed these two reverend gentlemen to detain us at our
      houses so as to let him have the field to himself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And of course,&rdquo; said the late Mr Shorter apologetically to me, &ldquo;as I had
      to keep a gentleman at home from keeping an appointment with a lady, I had
      to come with something rather hot and strong&mdash;rather urgent. It
      wouldn't have done to be tame.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;I acquit you of tameness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, sir,&rdquo; said the man respectfully, &ldquo;always very grateful for any
      recommendation, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The other man idly pushed back his artificial bald head, revealing close
      red hair, and spoke dreamily, perhaps under the influence of Basil's
      admirable Burgundy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's wonderful how common it's getting, gentlemen. Our office is busy
      from morning till night. I've no doubt you've often knocked up against us
      before. You just take notice. When an old bachelor goes on boring you with
      hunting stories, when you're burning to be introduced to somebody, he's
      from our bureau. When a lady calls on parish work and stops hours, just
      when you wanted to go to the Robinsons', she's from our bureau. The
      Robinson hand, sir, may be darkly seen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is one thing I don't understand,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;Why you are both
      vicars.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A shade crossed the brow of the temporary incumbent of Chuntsey, in Essex.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That may have been a mistake, sir,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;But it was not our fault.
      It was all the munificence of Captain Fraser. He requested that the
      highest price and talent on our tariff should be employed to detain you
      gentlemen. Now the highest payment in our office goes to those who
      impersonate vicars, as being the most respectable and more of a strain. We
      are paid five guineas a visit. We have had the good fortune to satisfy the
      firm with our work; and we are now permanently vicars. Before that we had
      two years as colonels, the next in our scale. Colonels are four guineas.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      Chapter 4. The Singular Speculation of the House-Agent
    </h2>
    <p>
      Lieutenant Drummond Keith was a man about whom conversation always burst
      like a thunderstorm the moment he left the room. This arose from many
      separate touches about him. He was a light, loose person, who wore light,
      loose clothes, generally white, as if he were in the tropics; he was lean
      and graceful, like a panther, and he had restless black eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was very impecunious. He had one of the habits of the poor, in a degree
      so exaggerated as immeasurably to eclipse the most miserable of the
      unemployed; I mean the habit of continual change of lodgings. There are
      inland tracts of London where, in the very heart of artificial
      civilization, humanity has almost become nomadic once more. But in that
      restless interior there was no ragged tramp so restless as the elegant
      officer in the loose white clothes. He had shot a great many things in his
      time, to judge from his conversation, from partridges to elephants, but
      his slangier acquaintances were of opinion that &ldquo;the moon&rdquo; had been not
      unfrequently amid the victims of his victorious rifle. The phrase is a
      fine one, and suggests a mystic, elvish, nocturnal hunting.
    </p>
    <p>
      He carried from house to house and from parish to parish a kit which
      consisted practically of five articles. Two odd-looking, large-bladed
      spears, tied together, the weapons, I suppose, of some savage tribe, a
      green umbrella, a huge and tattered copy of the Pickwick Papers, a big
      game rifle, and a large sealed jar of some unholy Oriental wine. These
      always went into every new lodging, even for one night; and they went in
      quite undisguised, tied up in wisps of string or straw, to the delight of
      the poetic gutter boys in the little grey streets.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had forgotten to mention that he always carried also his old regimental
      sword. But this raised another odd question about him. Slim and active as
      he was, he was no longer very young. His hair, indeed, was quite grey,
      though his rather wild almost Italian moustache retained its blackness,
      and his face was careworn under its almost Italian gaiety. To find a
      middle-aged man who has left the Army at the primitive rank of lieutenant
      is unusual and not necessarily encouraging. With the more cautious and
      solid this fact, like his endless flitting, did the mysterious gentleman
      no good.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lastly, he was a man who told the kind of adventures which win a man
      admiration, but not respect. They came out of queer places, where a good
      man would scarcely find himself, out of opium dens and gambling hells;
      they had the heat of the thieves' kitchens or smelled of a strange smoke
      from cannibal incantations. These are the kind of stories which discredit
      a person almost equally whether they are believed or no. If Keith's tales
      were false he was a liar; if they were true he had had, at any rate, every
      opportunity of being a scamp.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had just left the room in which I sat with Basil Grant and his brother
      Rupert, the voluble amateur detective. And as I say was invariably the
      case, we were all talking about him. Rupert Grant was a clever young
      fellow, but he had that tendency which youth and cleverness, when sharply
      combined, so often produce, a somewhat extravagant scepticism. He saw
      doubt and guilt everywhere, and it was meat and drink to him. I had often
      got irritated with this boyish incredulity of his, but on this particular
      occasion I am bound to say that I thought him so obviously right that I
      was astounded at Basil's opposing him, however banteringly.
    </p>
    <p>
      I could swallow a good deal, being naturally of a simple turn, but I could
      not swallow Lieutenant Keith's autobiography.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don't seriously mean, Basil,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;that you think that that
      fellow really did go as a stowaway with Nansen and pretend to be the Mad
      Mullah and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has one fault,&rdquo; said Basil thoughtfully, &ldquo;or virtue, as you may happen
      to regard it. He tells the truth in too exact and bald a style; he is too
      veracious.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! if you are going to be paradoxical,&rdquo; said Rupert contemptuously, &ldquo;be
      a bit funnier than that. Say, for instance, that he has lived all his life
      in one ancestral manor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, he's extremely fond of change of scene,&rdquo; replied Basil
      dispassionately, &ldquo;and of living in odd places. That doesn't prevent his
      chief trait being verbal exactitude. What you people don't understand is
      that telling a thing crudely and coarsely as it happened makes it sound
      frightfully strange. The sort of things Keith recounts are not the sort of
      things that a man would make up to cover himself with honour; they are too
      absurd. But they are the sort of things that a man would do if he were
      sufficiently filled with the soul of skylarking.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So far from paradox,&rdquo; said his brother, with something rather like a
      sneer, &ldquo;you seem to be going in for journalese proverbs. Do you believe
      that truth is stranger than fiction?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Truth must of necessity be stranger than fiction,&rdquo; said Basil placidly.
      &ldquo;For fiction is the creation of the human mind, and therefore is congenial
      to it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, your lieutenant's truth is stranger, if it is truth, than anything
      I ever heard of,&rdquo; said Rupert, relapsing into flippancy. &ldquo;Do you, on your
      soul, believe in all that about the shark and the camera?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe Keith's words,&rdquo; answered the other. &ldquo;He is an honest man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should like to question a regiment of his landladies,&rdquo; said Rupert
      cynically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must say, I think you can hardly regard him as unimpeachable merely in
      himself,&rdquo; I said mildly; &ldquo;his mode of life&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Before I could complete the sentence the door was flung open and Drummond
      Keith appeared again on the threshold, his white Panama on his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I say, Grant,&rdquo; he said, knocking off his cigarette ash against the door,
      &ldquo;I've got no money in the world till next April. Could you lend me a
      hundred pounds? There's a good chap.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rupert and I looked at each other in an ironical silence. Basil, who was
      sitting by his desk, swung the chair round idly on its screw and picked up
      a quill-pen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall I cross it?&rdquo; he asked, opening a cheque-book.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really,&rdquo; began Rupert, with a rather nervous loudness, &ldquo;since Lieutenant
      Keith has seen fit to make this suggestion to Basil before his family, I&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here you are, Ugly,&rdquo; said Basil, fluttering a cheque in the direction of
      the quite nonchalant officer. &ldquo;Are you in a hurry?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied Keith, in a rather abrupt way. &ldquo;As a matter of fact I want
      it now. I want to see my&mdash;er&mdash;business man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rupert was eyeing him sarcastically, and I could see that it was on the
      tip of his tongue to say, inquiringly, &ldquo;Receiver of stolen goods,
      perhaps.&rdquo; What he did say was:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A business man? That's rather a general description, Lieutenant Keith.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Keith looked at him sharply, and then said, with something rather like
      ill-temper:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's a thingum-my-bob, a house-agent, say. I'm going to see him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you're going to see a house-agent, are you?&rdquo; said Rupert Grant
      grimly. &ldquo;Do you know, Mr Keith, I think I should very much like to go with
      you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Basil shook with his soundless laughter. Lieutenant Keith started a
      little; his brow blackened sharply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I beg your pardon,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;What did you say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rupert's face had been growing from stage to stage of ferocious irony, and
      he answered:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was saying that I wondered whether you would mind our strolling along
      with you to this house-agent's.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The visitor swung his stick with a sudden whirling violence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, in God's name, come to my house-agent's! Come to my bedroom. Look
      under my bed. Examine my dust-bin. Come along!&rdquo; And with a furious energy
      which took away our breath he banged his way out of the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rupert Grant, his restless blue eyes dancing with his detective
      excitement, soon shouldered alongside him, talking to him with that
      transparent camaraderie which he imagined to be appropriate from the
      disguised policeman to the disguised criminal. His interpretation was
      certainly corroborated by one particular detail, the unmistakable unrest,
      annoyance, and nervousness of the man with whom he walked. Basil and I
      tramped behind, and it was not necessary for us to tell each other that we
      had both noticed this.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lieutenant Drummond Keith led us through very extraordinary and
      unpromising neighbourhoods in the search for his remarkable house-agent.
      Neither of the brothers Grant failed to notice this fact. As the streets
      grew closer and more crooked and the roofs lower and the gutters grosser
      with mud, a darker curiosity deepened on the brows of Basil, and the
      figure of Rupert seen from behind seemed to fill the street with a
      gigantic swagger of success. At length, at the end of the fourth or fifth
      lean grey street in that sterile district, we came suddenly to a halt, the
      mysterious lieutenant looking once more about him with a sort of sulky
      desperation. Above a row of shutters and a door, all indescribably dingy
      in appearance and in size scarce sufficient even for a penny toyshop, ran
      the inscription: &ldquo;P. Montmorency, House-Agent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is the office of which I spoke,&rdquo; said Keith, in a cutting voice.
      &ldquo;Will you wait here a moment, or does your astonishing tenderness about my
      welfare lead you to wish to overhear everything I have to say to my
      business adviser?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rupert's face was white and shaking with excitement; nothing on earth
      would have induced him now to have abandoned his prey.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you will excuse me,&rdquo; he said, clenching his hands behind his back, &ldquo;I
      think I should feel myself justified in&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! Come along in,&rdquo; exploded the lieutenant. He made the same gesture of
      savage surrender. And he slammed into the office, the rest of us at his
      heels.
    </p>
    <p>
      P. Montmorency, House-Agent, was a solitary old gentleman sitting behind a
      bare brown counter. He had an egglike head, froglike jaws, and a grey
      hairy fringe of aureole round the lower part of his face; the whole
      combined with a reddish, aquiline nose. He wore a shabby black frock-coat,
      a sort of semi-clerical tie worn at a very unclerical angle, and looked,
      generally speaking, about as unlike a house-agent as anything could look,
      short of something like a sandwich man or a Scotch Highlander.
    </p>
    <p>
      We stood inside the room for fully forty seconds, and the odd old
      gentleman did not look at us. Neither, to tell the truth, odd as he was,
      did we look at him. Our eyes were fixed, where his were fixed, upon
      something that was crawling about on the counter in front of him. It was a
      ferret.
    </p>
    <p>
      The silence was broken by Rupert Grant. He spoke in that sweet and steely
      voice which he reserved for great occasions and practised for hours
      together in his bedroom. He said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr Montmorency, I think?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The old gentleman started, lifted his eyes with a bland bewilderment,
      picked up the ferret by the neck, stuffed it alive into his trousers
      pocket, smiled apologetically, and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are a house-agent, are you not?&rdquo; asked Rupert.
    </p>
    <p>
      To the delight of that criminal investigator, Mr Montmorency's eyes
      wandered unquietly towards Lieutenant Keith, the only man present that he
      knew.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A house-agent,&rdquo; cried Rupert again, bringing out the word as if it were
      &ldquo;burglar'.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes... oh, yes,&rdquo; said the man, with a quavering and almost coquettish
      smile. &ldquo;I am a house-agent... oh, yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I think,&rdquo; said Rupert, with a sardonic sleekness, &ldquo;that Lieutenant
      Keith wants to speak to you. We have come in by his request.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lieutenant Keith was lowering gloomily, and now he spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have come, Mr Montmorency, about that house of mine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; said Montmorency, spreading his fingers on the flat counter.
      &ldquo;It's all ready, sir. I've attended to all your suggestions er&mdash;about
      the br&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Right,&rdquo; cried Keith, cutting the word short with the startling neatness
      of a gunshot. &ldquo;We needn't bother about all that. If you've done what I
      told you, all right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And he turned sharply towards the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Montmorency, House-Agent, presented a picture of pathos. After
      stammering a moment he said: &ldquo;Excuse me... Mr Keith... there was another
      matter... about which I wasn't quite sure. I tried to get all the heating
      apparatus possible under the circumstances ... but in winter... at that
      elevation...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can't expect much, eh?&rdquo; said the lieutenant, cutting in with the same
      sudden skill. &ldquo;No, of course not. That's all right, Montmorency. There
      can't be any more difficulties,&rdquo; and he put his hand on the handle of the
      door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think,&rdquo; said Rupert Grant, with a satanic suavity, &ldquo;that Mr Montmorency
      has something further to say to you, lieutenant.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only,&rdquo; said the house-agent, in desperation, &ldquo;what about the birds?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I beg your pardon,&rdquo; said Rupert, in a general blank.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What about the birds?&rdquo; said the house-agent doggedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Basil, who had remained throughout the proceedings in a state of
      Napoleonic calm, which might be more accurately described as a state of
      Napoleonic stupidity, suddenly lifted his leonine head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Before you go, Lieutenant Keith,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Come now. Really, what about
      the birds?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll take care of them,&rdquo; said Lieutenant Keith, still with his long back
      turned to us; &ldquo;they shan't suffer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, sir, thank you,&rdquo; cried the incomprehensible house-agent, with
      an air of ecstasy. &ldquo;You'll excuse my concern, sir. You know I'm wild on
      wild animals. I'm as wild as any of them on that. Thank you, sir. But
      there's another thing...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The lieutenant, with his back turned to us, exploded with an indescribable
      laugh and swung round to face us. It was a laugh, the purport of which was
      direct and essential, and yet which one cannot exactly express. As near as
      it said anything, verbally speaking, it said: &ldquo;Well, if you must spoil it,
      you must. But you don't know what you're spoiling.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is another thing,&rdquo; continued Mr Montmorency weakly. &ldquo;Of course, if
      you don't want to be visited you'll paint the house green, but&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Green!&rdquo; shouted Keith. &ldquo;Green! Let it be green or nothing. I won't have a
      house of another colour. Green!&rdquo; and before we could realize anything the
      door had banged between us and the street.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rupert Grant seemed to take a little time to collect himself; but he spoke
      before the echoes of the door died away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your client, Lieutenant Keith, appears somewhat excited,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;What
      is the matter with him? Is he unwell?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I should think not,&rdquo; said Mr Montmorency, in some confusion. &ldquo;The
      negotiations have been somewhat difficult&mdash;the house is rather&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Green,&rdquo; said Rupert calmly. &ldquo;That appears to be a very important point.
      It must be rather green. May I ask you, Mr Montmorency, before I rejoin my
      companion outside, whether, in your business, it is usual to ask for
      houses by their colour? Do clients write to a house-agent asking for a
      pink house or a blue house? Or, to take another instance, for a green
      house?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only,&rdquo; said Montmorency, trembling, &ldquo;only to be inconspicuous.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rupert had his ruthless smile. &ldquo;Can you tell me any place on earth in
      which a green house would be inconspicuous?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The house-agent was fidgeting nervously in his pocket. Slowly drawing out
      a couple of lizards and leaving them to run on the counter, he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; I can't.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can't suggest an explanation?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Mr Montmorency, rising slowly and yet in such a way as to
      suggest a sudden situation, &ldquo;I can't. And may I, as a busy man, be excused
      if I ask you, gentlemen, if you have any demand to make of me in
      connection with my business. What kind of house would you desire me to get
      for you, sir?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He opened his blank blue eyes on Rupert, who seemed for the second
      staggered. Then he recovered himself with perfect common sense and
      answered:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sorry, Mr Montmorency. The fascination of your remarks has unduly
      delayed us from joining our friend outside. Pray excuse my apparent
      impertinence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not at all, sir,&rdquo; said the house-agent, taking a South American spider
      idly from his waistcoat pocket and letting it climb up the slope of his
      desk. &ldquo;Not at all, sir. I hope you will favour me again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rupert Grant dashed out of the office in a gust of anger, anxious to face
      Lieutenant Keith. He was gone. The dull, starlit street was deserted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you say now?&rdquo; cried Rupert to his brother. His brother said
      nothing now.
    </p>
    <p>
      We all three strode down the street in silence, Rupert feverish, myself
      dazed, Basil, to all appearance, merely dull. We walked through grey
      street after grey street, turning corners, traversing squares, scarcely
      meeting anyone, except occasional drunken knots of two or three.
    </p>
    <p>
      In one small street, however, the knots of two or three began abruptly to
      thicken into knots of five or six and then into great groups and then into
      a crowd. The crowd was stirring very slightly. But anyone with a knowledge
      of the eternal populace knows that if the outside rim of a crowd stirs
      ever so slightly it means that there is madness in the heart and core of
      the mob. It soon became evident that something really important had
      happened in the centre of this excitement. We wormed our way to the front,
      with the cunning which is known only to cockneys, and once there we soon
      learned the nature of the difficulty. There had been a brawl concerned
      with some six men, and one of them lay almost dead on the stones of the
      street. Of the other four, all interesting matters were, as far as we were
      concerned, swallowed up in one stupendous fact. One of the four survivors
      of the brutal and perhaps fatal scuffle was the immaculate Lieutenant
      Keith, his clothes torn to ribbons, his eyes blazing, blood on his
      knuckles. One other thing, however, pointed at him in a worse manner. A
      short sword, or very long knife, had been drawn out of his elegant
      walking-stick, and lay in front of him upon the stones. It did not,
      however, appear to be bloody.
    </p>
    <p>
      The police had already pushed into the centre with their ponderous
      omnipotence, and even as they did so, Rupert Grant sprang forward with his
      incontrollable and intolerable secret.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is the man, constable,&rdquo; he shouted, pointing at the battered
      lieutenant. &ldquo;He is a suspicious character. He did the murder.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There's been no murder done, sir,&rdquo; said the policeman, with his automatic
      civility. &ldquo;The poor man's only hurt. I shall only be able to take the
      names and addresses of the men in the scuffle and have a good eye kept on
      them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have a good eye kept on that one,&rdquo; said Rupert, pale to the lips, and
      pointing to the ragged Keith.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right, sir,&rdquo; said the policeman unemotionally, and went the round of
      the people present, collecting the addresses. When he had completed his
      task the dusk had fallen and most of the people not immediately connected
      with the examination had gone away. He still found, however, one
      eager-faced stranger lingering on the outskirts of the affair. It was
      Rupert Grant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Constable,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I have a very particular reason for asking you a
      question. Would you mind telling me whether that military fellow who
      dropped his sword-stick in the row gave you an address or not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; said the policeman, after a reflective pause; &ldquo;yes, he gave me
      his address.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My name is Rupert Grant,&rdquo; said that individual, with some pomp. &ldquo;I have
      assisted the police on more than one occasion. I wonder whether you would
      tell me, as a special favour, what address?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The constable looked at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said slowly, &ldquo;if you like. His address is: The Elms, Buxton
      Common, near Purley, Surrey.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; said Rupert, and ran home through the gathering night as fast
      as his legs could carry him, repeating the address to himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rupert Grant generally came down late in a rather lordly way to breakfast;
      he contrived, I don't know how, to achieve always the attitude of the
      indulged younger brother. Next morning, however, when Basil and I came
      down we found him ready and restless.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said sharply to his brother almost before we sat down to the
      meal. &ldquo;What do you think of your Drummond Keith now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do I think of him?&rdquo; inquired Basil slowly. &ldquo;I don't think anything
      of him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm glad to hear it,&rdquo; said Rupert, buttering his toast with an energy
      that was somewhat exultant. &ldquo;I thought you'd come round to my view, but I
      own I was startled at your not seeing it from the beginning. The man is a
      translucent liar and knave.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think,&rdquo; said Basil, in the same heavy monotone as before, &ldquo;that I did
      not make myself clear. When I said that I thought nothing of him I meant
      grammatically what I said. I meant that I did not think about him; that he
      did not occupy my mind. You, however, seem to me to think a lot of him,
      since you think him a knave. I should say he was glaringly good myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I sometimes think you talk paradox for its own sake,&rdquo; said Rupert,
      breaking an egg with unnecessary sharpness. &ldquo;What the deuce is the sense
      of it? Here's a man whose original position was, by our common agreement,
      dubious. He's a wanderer, a teller of tall tales, a man who doesn't
      conceal his acquaintance with all the blackest and bloodiest scenes on
      earth. We take the trouble to follow him to one of his appointments, and
      if ever two human beings were plotting together and lying to every one
      else, he and that impossible house-agent were doing it. We followed him
      home, and the very same night he is in the thick of a fatal, or nearly
      fatal, brawl, in which he is the only man armed. Really, if this is being
      glaringly good, I must confess that the glare does not dazzle me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Basil was quite unmoved. &ldquo;I admit his moral goodness is of a certain kind,
      a quaint, perhaps a casual kind. He is very fond of change and experiment.
      But all the points you so ingeniously make against him are mere
      coincidence or special pleading. It's true he didn't want to talk about
      his house business in front of us. No man would. It's true that he carries
      a sword-stick. Any man might. It's true he drew it in the shock of a
      street fight. Any man would. But there's nothing really dubious in all
      this. There's nothing to confirm&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As he spoke a knock came at the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you please, sir,&rdquo; said the landlady, with an alarmed air, &ldquo;there's a
      policeman wants to see you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Show him in,&rdquo; said Basil, amid the blank silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      The heavy, handsome constable who appeared at the door spoke almost as
      soon as he appeared there.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think one of you gentlemen,&rdquo; he said, curtly but respectfully, &ldquo;was
      present at the affair in Copper Street last night, and drew my attention
      very strongly to a particular man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rupert half rose from his chair, with eyes like diamonds, but the
      constable went on calmly, referring to a paper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A young man with grey hair. Had light grey clothes, very good, but torn
      in the struggle. Gave his name as Drummond Keith.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is amusing,&rdquo; said Basil, laughing. &ldquo;I was in the very act of
      clearing that poor officer's character of rather fanciful aspersions. What
      about him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, sir,&rdquo; said the constable, &ldquo;I took all the men's addresses and had
      them all watched. It wasn't serious enough to do more than that. All the
      other addresses are all right. But this man Keith gave a false address.
      The place doesn't exist.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The breakfast table was nearly flung over as Rupert sprang up, slapping
      both his thighs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, by all that's good,&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;This is a sign from heaven.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's certainly very extraordinary,&rdquo; said Basil quietly, with knitted
      brows. &ldquo;It's odd the fellow should have given a false address, considering
      he was perfectly innocent in the&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you jolly old early Christian duffer,&rdquo; cried Rupert, in a sort of
      rapture, &ldquo;I don't wonder you couldn't be a judge. You think every one as
      good as yourself. Isn't the thing plain enough now? A doubtful
      acquaintance; rowdy stories, a most suspicious conversation, mean streets,
      a concealed knife, a man nearly killed, and, finally, a false address.
      That's what we call glaring goodness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's certainly very extraordinary,&rdquo; repeated Basil. And he strolled
      moodily about the room. Then he said: &ldquo;You are quite sure, constable, that
      there's no mistake? You got the address right, and the police have really
      gone to it and found it was a fraud?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was very simple, sir,&rdquo; said the policeman, chuckling. &ldquo;The place he
      named was a well-known common quite near London, and our people were down
      there this morning before any of you were awake. And there's no such
      house. In fact, there are hardly any houses at all. Though it is so near
      London, it's a blank moor with hardly five trees on it, to say nothing of
      Christians. Oh, no, sir, the address was a fraud right enough. He was a
      clever rascal, and chose one of those scraps of lost England that people
      know nothing about. Nobody could say off-hand that there was not a
      particular house dropped somewhere about the heath. But as a fact, there
      isn't.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Basil's face during this sensible speech had been growing darker and
      darker with a sort of desperate sagacity. He was cornered almost for the
      first time since I had known him; and to tell the truth I rather wondered
      at the almost childish obstinacy which kept him so close to his original
      prejudice in favour of the wildly questionable lieutenant. At length he
      said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You really searched the common? And the address was really not known in
      the district&mdash;by the way, what was the address?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The constable selected one of his slips of paper and consulted it, but
      before he could speak Rupert Grant, who was leaning in the window in a
      perfect posture of the quiet and triumphant detective, struck in with the
      sharp and suave voice he loved so much to use.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, I can tell you that, Basil,&rdquo; he said graciously as he idly plucked
      leaves from a plant in the window. &ldquo;I took the precaution to get this
      man's address from the constable last night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what was it?&rdquo; asked his brother gruffly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The constable will correct me if I am wrong,&rdquo; said Rupert, looking
      sweetly at the ceiling. &ldquo;It was: The Elms, Buxton Common, near Purley,
      Surrey.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Right, sir,&rdquo; said the policeman, laughing and folding up his papers.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a silence, and the blue eyes of Basil looked blindly for a few
      seconds into the void. Then his head fell back in his chair so suddenly
      that I started up, thinking him ill. But before I could move further his
      lips had flown apart (I can use no other phrase) and a peal of gigantic
      laughter struck and shook the ceiling&mdash;laughter that shook the
      laughter, laughter redoubled, laughter incurable, laughter that could not
      stop.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two whole minutes afterwards it was still unended; Basil was ill with
      laughter; but still he laughed. The rest of us were by this time ill
      almost with terror.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Excuse me,&rdquo; said the insane creature, getting at last to his feet. &ldquo;I am
      awfully sorry. It is horribly rude. And stupid, too. And also unpractical,
      because we have not much time to lose if we're to get down to that place.
      The train service is confoundedly bad, as I happen to know. It's quite out
      of proportion to the comparatively small distance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Get down to that place?&rdquo; I repeated blankly. &ldquo;Get down to what place?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have forgotten its name,&rdquo; said Basil vaguely, putting his hands in his
      pockets as he rose. &ldquo;Something Common near Purley. Has any one got a
      timetable?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don't seriously mean,&rdquo; cried Rupert, who had been staring in a sort
      of confusion of emotions. &ldquo;You don't mean that you want to go to Buxton
      Common, do you? You can't mean that!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why shouldn't I go to Buxton Common?&rdquo; asked Basil, smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why should you?&rdquo; said his brother, catching hold again restlessly of the
      plant in the window and staring at the speaker.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To find our friend, the lieutenant, of course,&rdquo; said Basil Grant. &ldquo;I
      thought you wanted to find him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rupert broke a branch brutally from the plant and flung it impatiently on
      the floor. &ldquo;And in order to find him,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you suggest the admirable
      expedient of going to the only place on the habitable earth where we know
      he can't be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The constable and I could not avoid breaking into a kind of assenting
      laugh, and Rupert, who had family eloquence, was encouraged to go on with
      a reiterated gesture:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He may be in Buckingham Palace; he may be sitting astride the cross of St
      Paul's; he may be in jail (which I think most likely); he may be in the
      Great Wheel; he may be in my pantry; he may be in your store cupboard; but
      out of all the innumerable points of space, there is only one where he has
      just been systematically looked for and where we know that he is not to be
      found&mdash;and that, if I understand you rightly, is where you want us to
      go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exactly,&rdquo; said Basil calmly, getting into his great-coat; &ldquo;I thought you
      might care to accompany me. If not, of course, make yourselves jolly here
      till I come back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It is our nature always to follow vanishing things and value them if they
      really show a resolution to depart. We all followed Basil, and I cannot
      say why, except that he was a vanishing thing, that he vanished decisively
      with his great-coat and his stick. Rupert ran after him with a
      considerable flurry of rationality.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear chap,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;do you really mean that you see any good in
      going down to this ridiculous scrub, where there is nothing but beaten
      tracks and a few twisted trees, simply because it was the first place that
      came into a rowdy lieutenant's head when he wanted to give a lying
      reference in a scrape?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Basil, taking out his watch, &ldquo;and, what's worse, we've lost
      the train.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He paused a moment and then added: &ldquo;As a matter of fact, I think we may
      just as well go down later in the day. I have some writing to do, and I
      think you told me, Rupert, that you thought of going to the Dulwich
      Gallery. I was rather too impetuous. Very likely he wouldn't be in. But if
      we get down by the 5.15, which gets to Purley about 6, I expect we shall
      just catch him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Catch him!&rdquo; cried his brother, in a kind of final anger. &ldquo;I wish we
      could. Where the deuce shall we catch him now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I keep forgetting the name of the common,&rdquo; said Basil, as he buttoned up
      his coat. &ldquo;The Elms&mdash;what is it? Buxton Common, near Purley. That's
      where we shall find him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But there is no such place,&rdquo; groaned Rupert; but he followed his brother
      downstairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      We all followed him. We snatched our hats from the hat-stand and our
      sticks from the umbrella-stand; and why we followed him we did not and do
      not know. But we always followed him, whatever was the meaning of the
      fact, whatever was the nature of his mastery. And the strange thing was
      that we followed him the more completely the more nonsensical appeared the
      thing which he said. At bottom, I believe, if he had risen from our
      breakfast table and said: &ldquo;I am going to find the Holy Pig with Ten
      Tails,&rdquo; we should have followed him to the end of the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      I don't know whether this mystical feeling of mine about Basil on this
      occasion has got any of the dark and cloudy colour, so to speak, of the
      strange journey that we made the same evening. It was already very dense
      twilight when we struck southward from Purley. Suburbs and things on the
      London border may be, in most cases, commonplace and comfortable. But if
      ever by any chance they really are empty solitudes they are to the human
      spirit more desolate and dehumanized than any Yorkshire moors or Highland
      hills, because the suddenness with which the traveller drops into that
      silence has something about it as of evil elf-land. It seems to be one of
      the ragged suburbs of the cosmos half-forgotten by God&mdash;such a place
      was Buxton Common, near Purley.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was certainly a sort of grey futility in the landscape itself. But
      it was enormously increased by the sense of grey futility in our
      expedition. The tracts of grey turf looked useless, the occasional
      wind-stricken trees looked useless, but we, the human beings, more useless
      than the hopeless turf or the idle trees. We were maniacs akin to the
      foolish landscape, for we were come to chase the wild goose which has led
      men and left men in bogs from the beginning. We were three dazed men under
      the captaincy of a madman going to look for a man whom we knew was not
      there in a house that had no existence. A livid sunset seemed to look at
      us with a sort of sickly smile before it died.
    </p>
    <p>
      Basil went on in front with his coat collar turned up, looking in the
      gloom rather like a grotesque Napoleon. We crossed swell after swell of
      the windy common in increasing darkness and entire silence. Suddenly Basil
      stopped and turned to us, his hands in his pockets. Through the dusk I
      could just detect that he wore a broad grin as of comfortable success.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he cried, taking his heavily gloved hands out of his pockets and
      slapping them together, &ldquo;here we are at last.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The wind swirled sadly over the homeless heath; two desolate elms rocked
      above us in the sky like shapeless clouds of grey. There was not a sign of
      man or beast to the sullen circle of the horizon, and in the midst of that
      wilderness Basil Grant stood rubbing his hands with the air of an
      innkeeper standing at an open door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How jolly it is,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;to get back to civilization. That notion
      that civilization isn't poetical is a civilised delusion. Wait till you've
      really lost yourself in nature, among the devilish woodlands and the cruel
      flowers. Then you'll know that there's no star like the red star of man
      that he lights on his hearthstone; no river like the red river of man, the
      good red wine, which you, Mr Rupert Grant, if I have any knowledge of you,
      will be drinking in two or three minutes in enormous quantities.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rupert and I exchanged glances of fear. Basil went on heartily, as the
      wind died in the dreary trees.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You'll find our host a much more simple kind of fellow in his own house.
      I did when I visited him when he lived in the cabin at Yarmouth, and again
      in the loft at the city warehouse. He's really a very good fellow. But his
      greatest virtue remains what I said originally.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; I asked, finding his speech straying towards a sort of
      sanity. &ldquo;What is his greatest virtue?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His greatest virtue,&rdquo; replied Basil, &ldquo;is that he always tells the literal
      truth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, really,&rdquo; cried Rupert, stamping about between cold and anger, and
      slapping himself like a cabman, &ldquo;he doesn't seem to have been very literal
      or truthful in this case, nor you either. Why the deuce, may I ask, have
      you brought us out to this infernal place?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He was too truthful, I confess,&rdquo; said Basil, leaning against the tree;
      &ldquo;too hardly veracious, too severely accurate. He should have indulged in a
      little more suggestiveness and legitimate romance. But come, it's time we
      went in. We shall be late for dinner.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rupert whispered to me with a white face:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it a hallucination, do you think? Does he really fancy he sees a
      house?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose so,&rdquo; I said. Then I added aloud, in what was meant to be a
      cheery and sensible voice, but which sounded in my ears almost as strange
      as the wind:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, come, Basil, my dear fellow. Where do you want us to go?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, up here,&rdquo; cried Basil, and with a bound and a swing he was above our
      heads, swarming up the grey column of the colossal tree.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come up, all of you,&rdquo; he shouted out of the darkness, with the voice of a
      schoolboy. &ldquo;Come up. You'll be late for dinner.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The two great elms stood so close together that there was scarcely a yard
      anywhere, and in some places not more than a foot, between them. Thus
      occasional branches and even bosses and boles formed a series of footholds
      that almost amounted to a rude natural ladder. They must, I supposed, have
      been some sport of growth, Siamese twins of vegetation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Why we did it I cannot think; perhaps, as I have said, the mystery of the
      waste and dark had brought out and made primary something wholly mystical
      in Basil's supremacy. But we only felt that there was a giant's staircase
      going somewhere, perhaps to the stars; and the victorious voice above
      called to us out of heaven. We hoisted ourselves up after him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Half-way up some cold tongue of the night air struck and sobered me
      suddenly. The hypnotism of the madman above fell from me, and I saw the
      whole map of our silly actions as clearly as if it were printed. I saw
      three modern men in black coats who had begun with a perfectly sensible
      suspicion of a doubtful adventurer and who had ended, God knows how,
      half-way up a naked tree on a naked moorland, far from that adventurer and
      all his works, that adventurer who was at that moment, in all probability,
      laughing at us in some dirty Soho restaurant. He had plenty to laugh at us
      about, and no doubt he was laughing his loudest; but when I thought what
      his laughter would be if he knew where we were at that moment, I nearly
      let go of the tree and fell.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Swinburne,&rdquo; said Rupert suddenly, from above, &ldquo;what are we doing? Let's
      get down again,&rdquo; and by the mere sound of his voice I knew that he too
      felt the shock of wakening to reality.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We can't leave poor Basil,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;Can't you call to him or get hold of
      him by the leg?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's too far ahead,&rdquo; answered Rupert; &ldquo;he's nearly at the top of the
      beastly thing. Looking for Lieutenant Keith in the rooks' nests, I
      suppose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We were ourselves by this time far on our frantic vertical journey. The
      mighty trunks were beginning to sway and shake slightly in the wind. Then
      I looked down and saw something which made me feel that we were far from
      the world in a sense and to a degree that I cannot easily describe. I saw
      that the almost straight lines of the tall elm trees diminished a little
      in perspective as they fell. I was used to seeing parallel lines taper
      towards the sky. But to see them taper towards the earth made me feel lost
      in space, like a falling star.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can nothing be done to stop Basil?&rdquo; I called out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; answered my fellow climber. &ldquo;He's too far up. He must get to the
      top, and when he finds nothing but wind and leaves he may go sane again.
      Hark at him above there; you can just hear him talking to himself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps he's talking to us,&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Rupert, &ldquo;he'd shout if he was. I've never known him to talk to
      himself before; I'm afraid he really is bad tonight; it's a known sign of
      the brain going.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; I said sadly, and listened. Basil's voice certainly was sounding
      above us, and not by any means in the rich and riotous tones in which he
      had hailed us before. He was speaking quietly, and laughing every now and
      then, up there among the leaves and stars.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a silence mingled with this murmur, Rupert Grant suddenly said, &ldquo;My
      God!&rdquo; with a violent voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's the matter&mdash;are you hurt?&rdquo; I cried, alarmed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. Listen to Basil,&rdquo; said the other in a very strange voice. &ldquo;He's not
      talking to himself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then he is talking to us,&rdquo; I cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Rupert simply, &ldquo;he's talking to somebody else.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Great branches of the elm loaded with leaves swung about us in a sudden
      burst of wind, but when it died down I could still hear the conversational
      voice above. I could hear two voices.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly from aloft came Basil's boisterous hailing voice as before: &ldquo;Come
      up, you fellows. Here's Lieutenant Keith.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And a second afterwards came the half-American voice we had heard in our
      chambers more than once. It called out:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Happy to see you, gentlemen; pray come in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Out of a hole in an enormous dark egg-shaped thing, pendent in the
      branches like a wasps' nest, was protruding the pale face and fierce
      moustache of the lieutenant, his teeth shining with that slightly Southern
      air that belonged to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Somehow or other, stunned and speechless, we lifted ourselves heavily into
      the opening. We fell into the full glow of a lamp-lit, cushioned, tiny
      room, with a circular wall lined with books, a circular table, and a
      circular seat around it. At this table sat three people. One was Basil,
      who, in the instant after alighting there, had fallen into an attitude of
      marmoreal ease as if he had been there from boyhood; he was smoking a
      cigar with a slow pleasure. The second was Lieutenant Drummond Keith, who
      looked happy also, but feverish and doubtful compared with his granite
      guest. The third was the little bald-headed house-agent with the wild
      whiskers, who called himself Montmorency. The spears, the green umbrella,
      and the cavalry sword hung in parallels on the wall. The sealed jar of
      strange wine was on the mantelpiece, the enormous rifle in the corner. In
      the middle of the table was a magnum of champagne. Glasses were already
      set for us.
    </p>
    <p>
      The wind of the night roared far below us, like an ocean at the foot of a
      light-house. The room stirred slightly, as a cabin might in a mild sea.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our glasses were filled, and we still sat there dazed and dumb. Then Basil
      spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You seem still a little doubtful, Rupert. Surely there is no further
      question about the cold veracity of our injured host.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't quite grasp it all,&rdquo; said Rupert, blinking still in the sudden
      glare. &ldquo;Lieutenant Keith said his address was&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's really quite right, sir,&rdquo; said Keith, with an open smile. &ldquo;The bobby
      asked me where I lived. And I said, quite truthfully, that I lived in the
      elms on Buxton Common, near Purley. So I do. This gentleman, Mr
      Montmorency, whom I think you have met before, is an agent for houses of
      this kind. He has a special line in arboreal villas. It's being kept
      rather quiet at present, because the people who want these houses don't
      want them to get too common. But it's just the sort of thing a fellow like
      myself, racketing about in all sorts of queer corners of London, naturally
      knocks up against.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you really an agent for arboreal villas?&rdquo; asked Rupert eagerly,
      recovering his ease with the romance of reality.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Montmorency, in his embarrassment, fingered one of his pockets and
      nervously pulled out a snake, which crawled about the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;W-well, yes, sir,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;The fact was&mdash;er&mdash;my people wanted
      me very much to go into the house-agency business. But I never cared
      myself for anything but natural history and botany and things like that.
      My poor parents have been dead some years now, but&mdash;naturally I like
      to respect their wishes. And I thought somehow that an arboreal villa
      agency was a sort of&mdash;of compromise between being a botanist and
      being a house-agent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rupert could not help laughing. &ldquo;Do you have much custom?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;N-not much,&rdquo; replied Mr Montmorency, and then he glanced at Keith, who
      was (I am convinced) his only client. &ldquo;But what there is&mdash;very
      select.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear friends,&rdquo; said Basil, puffing his cigar, &ldquo;always remember two
      facts. The first is that though when you are guessing about any one who is
      sane, the sanest thing is the most likely; when you are guessing about any
      one who is, like our host, insane, the maddest thing is the most likely.
      The second is to remember that very plain literal fact always seems
      fantastic. If Keith had taken a little brick box of a house in Clapham
      with nothing but railings in front of it and had written 'The Elms' over
      it, you wouldn't have thought there was anything fantastic about that.
      Simply because it was a great blaring, swaggering lie you would have
      believed it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Drink your wine, gentlemen,&rdquo; said Keith, laughing, &ldquo;for this confounded
      wind will upset it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We drank, and as we did so, although the hanging house, by a cunning
      mechanism, swung only slightly, we knew that the great head of the elm
      tree swayed in the sky like a stricken thistle.

    <h2>
      Chapter 5. The Noticeable Conduct of Professor Chadd
    </h2>
    <p>
      Basil Grant had comparatively few friends besides myself; yet he was the
      reverse of an unsociable man. He would talk to any one anywhere, and talk
      not only well but with perfectly genuine concern and enthusiasm for that
      person's affairs. He went through the world, as it were, as if he were
      always on the top of an omnibus or waiting for a train. Most of these
      chance acquaintances, of course, vanished into darkness out of his life. A
      few here and there got hooked on to him, so to speak, and became his
      lifelong intimates, but there was an accidental look about all of them as
      if they were windfalls, samples taken at random, goods fallen from a goods
      train or presents fished out of a bran-pie. One would be, let us say, a
      veterinary surgeon with the appearance of a jockey; another, a mild
      prebendary with a white beard and vague views; another, a young captain in
      the Lancers, seemingly exactly like other captains in the Lancers;
      another, a small dentist from Fulham, in all reasonable certainty
      precisely like every other dentist from Fulham. Major Brown, small, dry,
      and dapper, was one of these; Basil had made his acquaintance over a
      discussion in a hotel cloak-room about the right hat, a discussion which
      reduced the little major almost to a kind of masculine hysterics, the
      compound of the selfishness of an old bachelor and the scrupulosity of an
      old maid. They had gone home in a cab together and then dined with each
      other twice a week until they died. I myself was another. I had met Grant
      while he was still a judge, on the balcony of the National Liberal Club,
      and exchanged a few words about the weather. Then we had talked for about
      an hour about politics and God; for men always talk about the most
      important things to total strangers. It is because in the total stranger
      we perceive man himself; the image of God is not disguised by resemblances
      to an uncle or doubts of the wisdom of a moustache.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the most interesting of Basil's motley group of acquaintances was
      Professor Chadd. He was known to the ethnological world (which is a very
      interesting world, but a long way off this one) as the second greatest, if
      not the greatest, authority on the relations of savages to language. He
      was known to the neighbourhood of Hart Street, Bloomsbury, as a bearded
      man with a bald head, spectacles, and a patient face, the face of an
      unaccountable Nonconformist who had forgotten how to be angry. He went to
      and fro between the British Museum and a selection of blameless tea-shops,
      with an armful of books and a poor but honest umbrella. He was never seen
      without the books and the umbrella, and was supposed (by the lighter wits
      of the Persian MS. room) to go to bed with them in his little brick villa
      in the neighbourhood of Shepherd's Bush. There he lived with three
      sisters, ladies of solid goodness, but sinister demeanour. His life was
      happy, as are almost all the lives of methodical students, but one would
      not have called it exhilarating. His only hours of exhilaration occurred
      when his friend, Basil Grant, came into the house, late at night, a
      tornado of conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Basil, though close on sixty, had moods of boisterous babyishness, and
      these seemed for some reason or other to descend upon him particularly in
      the house of his studious and almost dingy friend. I can remember vividly
      (for I was acquainted with both parties and often dined with them) the
      gaiety of Grant on that particular evening when the strange calamity fell
      upon the professor. Professor Chadd was, like most of his particular class
      and type (the class that is at once academic and middle-class), a Radical
      of a solemn and old-fashioned type. Grant was a Radical himself, but he
      was that more discriminating and not uncommon type of Radical who passes
      most of his time in abusing the Radical party. Chadd had just contributed
      to a magazine an article called &ldquo;Zulu Interests and the New Makango
      Frontier', in which a precise scientific report of his study of the
      customs of the people of T'Chaka was reinforced by a severe protest
      against certain interferences with these customs both by the British and
      the Germans. He-was sitting with the magazine in front of him, the
      lamplight shining on his spectacles, a wrinkle in his forehead, not of
      anger, but of perplexity, as Basil Grant strode up and down the room,
      shaking it with his voice, with his high spirits and his heavy tread.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's not your opinions that I object to, my esteemed Chadd,&rdquo; he was
      saying, &ldquo;it's you. You are quite right to champion the Zulus, but for all
      that you do not sympathize with them. No doubt you know the Zulu way of
      cooking tomatoes and the Zulu prayer before blowing one's nose; but for
      all that you don't understand them as well as I do, who don't know an
      assegai from an alligator. You are more learned, Chadd, but I am more
      Zulu. Why is it that the jolly old barbarians of this earth are always
      championed by people who are their antithesis? Why is it? You are
      sagacious, you are benevolent, you are well informed, but, Chadd, you are
      not savage. Live no longer under that rosy illusion. Look in the glass.
      Ask your sisters. Consult the librarian of the British Museum. Look at
      this umbrella.&rdquo; And he held up that sad but still respectable article.
      &ldquo;Look at it. For ten mortal years to my certain knowledge you have carried
      that object under your arm, and I have no sort of doubt that you carried
      it at the age of eight months, and it never occurred to you to give one
      wild yell and hurl it like a javelin&mdash;thus&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And he sent the umbrella whizzing past the professor's bald head, so that
      it knocked over a pile of books with a crash and left a vase rocking.
    </p>
    <p>
      Professor Chadd appeared totally unmoved, with his face still lifted to
      the lamp and the wrinkle cut in his forehead.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your mental processes,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;always go a little too fast. And they
      are stated without method. There is no kind of inconsistency&rdquo;&mdash;and no
      words can convey the time he took to get to the end of the word&mdash;&ldquo;between
      valuing the right of the aborigines to adhere to their stage in the
      evolutionary process, so long as they find it congenial and requisite to
      do so. There is, I say, no inconsistency between this concession which I
      have just described to you and the view that the evolutionary stage in
      question is, nevertheless, so far as we can form any estimate of values in
      the variety of cosmic processes, definable in some degree as an inferior
      evolutionary stage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nothing but his lips had moved as he spoke, and his glasses still shone
      like two pallid moons.
    </p>
    <p>
      Grant was shaking with laughter as he watched him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;there is no inconsistency, my son of the red spear. But
      there is a great deal of incompatibility of temper. I am very far from
      being certain that the Zulu is on an inferior evolutionary stage, whatever
      the blazes that may mean. I do not think there is anything stupid or
      ignorant about howling at the moon or being afraid of devils in the dark.
      It seems to me perfectly philosophical. Why should a man be thought a sort
      of idiot because he feels the mystery and peril of existence itself?
      Suppose, my dear Chadd, suppose it is we who are the idiots because we are
      not afraid of devils in the dark?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Professor Chadd slit open a page of the magazine with a bone paper-knife
      and the intent reverence of the bibliophile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Beyond all question,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;it is a tenable hypothesis. I allude to
      the hypothesis which I understand you to entertain, that our civilization
      is not or may not be an advance upon, and indeed (if I apprehend you), is
      or may be a retrogression from states identical with or analogous to the
      state of the Zulus. Moreover, I shall be inclined to concede that such a
      proposition is of the nature, in some degree at least, of a primary
      proposition, and cannot adequately be argued, in the same sense, I mean,
      that the primary proposition of pessimism, or the primary proposition of
      the non-existence of matter, cannot adequately be argued. But I do not
      conceive you to be under the impression that you have demonstrated
      anything more concerning this proposition than that it is tenable, which,
      after all, amounts to little more than the statement that it is not a
      contradiction in terms.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Basil threw a book at his head and took out a cigar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don't understand,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but, on the other hand, as a
      compensation, you don't mind smoking. Why you don't object to that
      disgustingly barbaric rite I can't think. I can only say that I began it
      when I began to be a Zulu, about the age of ten. What I maintained was
      that although you knew more about Zulus in the sense that you are a
      scientist, I know more about them in the sense that I am a savage. For
      instance, your theory of the origin of language, something about its
      having come from the formulated secret language of some individual
      creature, though you knocked me silly with facts and scholarship in its
      favour, still does not convince me, because I have a feeling that that is
      not the way that things happen. If you ask me why I think so I can only
      answer that I am a Zulu; and if you ask me (as you most certainly will)
      what is my definition of a Zulu, I can answer that also. He is one who has
      climbed a Sussex apple-tree at seven and been afraid of a ghost in an
      English lane.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your process of thought&mdash;&rdquo; began the immovable Chadd, but his speech
      was interrupted. His sister, with that masculinity which always in such
      families concentrates in sisters, flung open the door with a rigid arm and
      said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;James, Mr Bingham of the British Museum wants to see you again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The philosopher rose with a dazed look, which always indicates in such men
      the fact that they regard philosophy as a familiar thing, but practical
      life as a weird and unnerving vision, and walked dubiously out of the
      room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope you do not mind my being aware of it, Miss Chadd,&rdquo; said Basil
      Grant, &ldquo;but I hear that the British Museum has recognized one of the men
      who have deserved well of their commonwealth. It is true, is it not, that
      Professor Chadd is likely to be made keeper of Asiatic manuscripts?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The grim face of the spinster betrayed a great deal of pleasure and a
      great deal of pathos also. &ldquo;I believe it's true,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;If it is, it
      will not only be great glory which women, I assure you, feel a great deal,
      but great relief, which they feel more; relief from worry from a lot of
      things. James' health has never been good, and while we are as poor as we
      are he had to do journalism and coaching, in addition to his own dreadful
      grinding notions and discoveries, which he loves more than man, woman, or
      child. I have often been afraid that unless something of this kind
      occurred we should really have to be careful of his brain. But I believe
      it is practically settled.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am delighted,&rdquo; began Basil, but with a worried face, &ldquo;but these
      red-tape negotiations are so terribly chancy that I really can't advise
      you to build on hope, only to be hurled down into bitterness. I've known
      men, and good men like your brother, come nearer than this and be
      disappointed. Of course, if it is true&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If it is true,&rdquo; said the woman fiercely, &ldquo;it means that people who have
      never lived may make an attempt at living.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Even as she spoke the professor came into the room still with the dazed
      look in his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it true?&rdquo; asked Basil, with burning eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a bit true,&rdquo; answered Chadd after a moment's bewilderment. &ldquo;Your
      argument was in three points fallacious.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; demanded Grant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the professor slowly, &ldquo;in saying that you could possess a
      knowledge of the essence of Zulu life distinct from&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! confound Zulu life,&rdquo; cried Grant, with a burst of laughter. &ldquo;I mean,
      have you got the post?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean the post of keeper of the Asiatic manuscripts,&rdquo; he said, opening
      his eye with childlike wonder. &ldquo;Oh, yes, I got that. But the real
      objection to your argument, which has only, I admit, occurred to me since
      I have been out of the room, is that it does not merely presuppose a Zulu
      truth apart from the facts, but infers that the discovery of it is
      absolutely impeded by the facts.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am crushed,&rdquo; said Basil, and sat down to laugh, while the professor's
      sister retired to her room, possibly, possibly not.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was extremely late when we left the Chadds, and it is an extremely long
      and tiresome journey from Shepherd's Bush to Lambeth. This may be our
      excuse for the fact that we (for I was stopping the night with Grant) got
      down to breakfast next day at a time inexpressibly criminal, a time, in
      point of fact, close upon noon. Even to that belated meal we came in a
      very lounging and leisurely fashion. Grant, in particular, seemed so
      dreamy at table that he scarcely saw the pile of letters by his plate, and
      I doubt if he would have opened any of them if there had not lain on the
      top that one thing which has succeeded amid modern carelessness in being
      really urgent and coercive&mdash;a telegram. This he opened with the same
      heavy distraction with which he broke his egg and drank his tea. When he
      read it he did not stir a hair or say a word, but something, I know not
      what, made me feel that the motionless figure had been pulled together
      suddenly as strings are tightened on a slack guitar. Though he said
      nothing and did not move, I knew that he had been for an instant cleared
      and sharpened with a shock of cold water. It was scarcely any surprise to
      me when a man who had drifted sullenly to his seat and fallen into it,
      kicked it away like a cur from under him and came round to me in two
      strides.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you make of that?&rdquo; he said, and flattened out the wire in front
      of me.
    </p>
    <p>
      It ran: &ldquo;Please come at once. James' mental state dangerous. Chadd.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What does the woman mean?&rdquo; I said after a pause, irritably. &ldquo;Those women
      have been saying that the poor old professor was mad ever since he was
      born.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are mistaken,&rdquo; said Grant composedly. &ldquo;It is true that all sensible
      women think all studious men mad. It is true, for the matter of that, all
      women of any kind think all men of any kind mad. But they don't put it in
      telegrams, any more than they wire to you that grass is green or God
      all-merciful. These things are truisms, and often private ones at that. If
      Miss Chadd has written down under the eye of a strange woman in a
      post-office that her brother is off his head you may be perfectly certain
      that she did it because it was a matter of life and death, and she can
      think of no other way of forcing us to come promptly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It will force us of course,&rdquo; I said, smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; he replied; &ldquo;there is a cab-rank near.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Basil scarcely said a word as we drove across Westminster Bridge, through
      Trafalgar Square, along Piccadilly, and up the Uxbridge Road. Only as he
      was opening the gate he spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think you will take my word for it, my friend,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;this is one
      of the most queer and complicated and astounding incidents that ever
      happened in London or, for that matter, in any high civilization.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I confess with the greatest sympathy and reverence that I don't quite see
      it,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;Is it so very extraordinary or complicated that a dreamy
      somnambulant old invalid who has always walked on the borders of the
      inconceivable should go mad under the shock of great joy? Is it so very
      extraordinary that a man with a head like a turnip and a soul like a
      spider's web should not find his strength equal to a confounding change of
      fortunes? Is it, in short, so very extraordinary that James Chadd should
      lose his wits from excitement?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would not be extraordinary in the least,&rdquo; answered Basil, with
      placidity. &ldquo;It would not be extraordinary in the least,&rdquo; he repeated, &ldquo;if
      the professor had gone mad. That was not the extraordinary circumstance to
      which I referred.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What,&rdquo; I asked, stamping my foot, &ldquo;was the extraordinary thing?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The extraordinary thing,&rdquo; said Basil, ringing the bell, &ldquo;is that he has
      not gone mad from excitement.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The tall and angular figure of the eldest Miss Chadd blocked the doorway
      as the door opened. Two other Miss Chadds seemed in the same way to be
      blocking the narrow passage and the little parlour. There was a general
      sense of their keeping something from view. They seemed like three
      black-clad ladies in some strange play of Maeterlinck, veiling the
      catastrophe from the audience in the manner of the Greek chorus.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sit down, won't you?&rdquo; said one of them, in a voice that was somewhat
      rigid with pain. &ldquo;I think you had better be told first what has happened.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then, with her bleak face looking unmeaningly out of the window, she
      continued, in an even and mechanical voice:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had better state everything that occurred just as it occurred. This
      morning I was clearing away the breakfast things, my sisters were both
      somewhat unwell, and had not come down. My brother had just gone out of
      the room, I believe, to fetch a book. He came back again, however, without
      it, and stood for some time staring at the empty grate. I said, 'Were you
      looking for anything I could get?' He did not answer, but this constantly
      happens, as he is often very abstracted. I repeated my question, and still
      he did not answer. Sometimes he is so wrapped up in his studies that
      nothing but a touch on the shoulder would make him aware of one's
      presence, so I came round the table towards him. I really do not know how
      to describe the sensation which I then had. It seems simply silly, but at
      the moment it seemed something enormous, upsetting one's brain. The fact
      is, James was standing on one leg.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Grant smiled slowly and rubbed his hands with a kind of care.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Standing on one leg?&rdquo; I repeated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied the dead voice of the woman without an inflection to
      suggest that she felt the fantasticality of her statement. &ldquo;He was
      standing on the left leg and the right drawn up at a sharp angle, the toe
      pointing downwards. I asked him if his leg hurt him. His only answer was
      to shoot the leg straight at right angles to the other, as if pointing to
      the other with his toe to the wall. He was still looking quite gravely at
      the fireplace.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'James, what is the matter?' I cried, for I was thoroughly frightened.
      James gave three kicks in the air with the right leg, flung up the other,
      gave three kicks in the air with it also and spun round like a teetotum
      the other way. 'Are you mad?' I cried. 'Why don't you answer me?' He had
      come to a standstill facing me, and was looking at me as he always does,
      with his lifted eyebrows and great spectacled eyes. When I had spoken he
      remained a second or two motionless, and then his only reply was to lift
      his left foot slowly from the floor and describe circles with it in the
      air. I rushed to the door and shouted for Christina. I will not dwell on
      the dreadful hours that followed. All three of us talked to him, implored
      him to speak to us with appeals that might have brought back the dead, but
      he has done nothing but hop and dance and kick with a solemn silent face.
      It looks as if his legs belonged to some one else or were possessed by
      devils. He has never spoken to us from that time to this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where is he now?&rdquo; I said, getting up in some agitation. &ldquo;We ought not to
      leave him alone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Doctor Colman is with him,&rdquo; said Miss Chadd calmly. &ldquo;They are in the
      garden. Doctor Colman thought the air would do him good. And he can
      scarcely go into the street.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Basil and I walked rapidly to the window which looked out on the garden.
      It was a small and somewhat smug suburban garden; the flower beds a little
      too neat and like the pattern of a coloured carpet; but on this shining
      and opulent summer day even they had the exuberance of something natural,
      I had almost said tropical. In the middle of a bright and verdant but
      painfully circular lawn stood two figures. One of them was a small,
      sharp-looking man with black whiskers and a very polished hat (I presume
      Dr Colman), who was talking very quietly and clearly, yet with a nervous
      twitch, as it were, in his face. The other was our old friend, listening
      with his old forbearing expression and owlish eyes, the strong sunlight
      gleaming on his glasses as the lamplight had gleamed the night before,
      when the boisterous Basil had rallied him on his studious decorum. But for
      one thing the figure of this morning might have been the identical figure
      of last night. That one thing was that while the face listened reposefully
      the legs were industriously dancing like the legs of a marionette. The
      neat flowers and the sunny glitter of the garden lent an indescribable
      sharpness and incredibility to the prodigy&mdash;the prodigy of the head
      of a hermit and the legs of a harlequin. For miracles should always happen
      in broad daylight. The night makes them credible and therefore
      commonplace.
    </p>
    <p>
      The second sister had by this time entered the room and came somewhat
      drearily to the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know, Adelaide,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;that Mr Bingham from the Museum is coming
      again at three.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know,&rdquo; said Adelaide Chadd bitterly. &ldquo;I suppose we shall have to tell
      him about this. I thought that no good fortune would ever come easily to
      us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Grant suddenly turned round. &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;What will you
      have to tell Mr Bingham?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know what I shall have to tell him,&rdquo; said the professor's sister,
      almost fiercely. &ldquo;I don't know that we need give it its wretched name. Do
      you think that the keeper of Asiatic manuscripts will be allowed to go on
      like that?&rdquo; And she pointed for an instant at the figure in the garden,
      the shining, listening face and the unresting feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Basil Grant took out his watch with an abrupt movement. &ldquo;When did you say
      the British Museum man was coming?&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Three o'clock,&rdquo; said Miss Chadd briefly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I have an hour before me,&rdquo; said Grant, and without another word
      threw up the window and jumped out into the garden. He did not walk
      straight up to the doctor and lunatic, but strolling round the garden path
      drew near them cautiously and yet apparently carelessly. He stood a couple
      of feet off them, seemingly counting halfpence out of his trousers pocket,
      but, as I could see, looking up steadily under the broad brim of his hat.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly he stepped up to Professor Chadd's elbow, and said, in a loud
      familiar voice, &ldquo;Well, my boy, do you still think the Zulus our
      inferiors?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The doctor knitted his brows and looked anxious, seeming to be about to
      speak. The professor turned his bald and placid head towards Grant in a
      friendly manner, but made no answer, idly flinging his left leg about.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you converted Dr Colman to your views?&rdquo; Basil continued, still in
      the same loud and lucid tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Chadd only shuffled his feet and kicked a little with the other leg, his
      expression still benevolent and inquiring. The doctor cut in rather
      sharply. &ldquo;Shall we go inside, professor?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Now you have shown me
      the garden. A beautiful garden. A most beautiful garden. Let us go in,&rdquo;
       and he tried to draw the kicking ethnologist by the elbow, at the same
      time whispering to Grant: &ldquo;I must ask you not to trouble him with
      questions. Most risky. He must be soothed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Basil answered in the same tone, with great coolness:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course your directions must be followed out, doctor. I will endeavour
      to do so, but I hope it will not be inconsistent with them if you will
      leave me alone with my poor friend in this garden for an hour. I want to
      watch him. I assure you, Dr Colman, that I shall say very little to him,
      and that little shall be as soothing as&mdash;as syrup.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The doctor wiped his eyeglass thoughtfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is rather dangerous for him,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;to be long in the strong sun
      without his hat. With his bald head, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is soon settled,&rdquo; said Basil composedly, and took off his own big
      hat and clapped it on the egglike skull of the professor. The latter did
      not turn round but danced away with his eyes on the horizon.
    </p>
    <p>
      The doctor put on his glasses again, looked severely at the two for some
      seconds, with his head on one side like a bird's, and then saying,
      shortly, &ldquo;All right,&rdquo; strutted away into the house, where the three Misses
      Chadd were all looking out from the parlour window on to the garden. They
      looked out on it with hungry eyes for a full hour without moving, and they
      saw a sight which was more extraordinary than madness itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Basil Grant addressed a few questions to the madman, without succeeding in
      making him do anything but continue to caper, and when he had done this
      slowly took a red note-book out of one pocket and a large pencil out of
      another.
    </p>
    <p>
      He began hurriedly to scribble notes. When the lunatic skipped away from
      him he would walk a few yards in pursuit, stop, and make notes again. Thus
      they followed each other round and round the foolish circle of turf, the
      one writing in pencil with the face of a man working out a problem, the
      other leaping and playing like a child.
    </p>
    <p>
      After about three-quarters of an hour of this imbecile scene, Grant put
      the pencil in his pocket, but kept the note-book open in his hand, and
      walking round the mad professor, planted himself directly in front of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then occurred something that even those already used to that wild morning
      had not anticipated or dreamed. The professor, on finding Basil in front
      of him, stared with a blank benignity for a few seconds, and then drew up
      his left leg and hung it bent in the attitude that his sister had
      described as being the first of all his antics. And the moment he had done
      it Basil Grant lifted his own leg and held it out rigid before him,
      confronting Chadd with the flat sole of his boot. The professor dropped
      his bent leg, and swinging his weight on to it kicked out the other
      behind, like a man swimming. Basil crossed his feet like a saltire cross,
      and then flung them apart again, giving a leap into the air. Then before
      any of the spectators could say a word or even entertain a thought about
      the matter, both of them were dancing a sort of jig or hornpipe opposite
      each other; and the sun shone down on two madmen instead of one.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were so stricken with the deafness and blindness of monomania that
      they did not see the eldest Miss Chadd come out feverishly into the garden
      with gestures of entreaty, a gentleman following her. Professor Chadd was
      in the wildest posture of a pas-de-quatre, Basil Grant seemed about to
      turn a cart-wheel, when they were frozen in their follies by the steely
      voice of Adelaide Chadd saying, &ldquo;Mr Bingham of the British Museum.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr Bingham was a slim, well-clad gentleman with a pointed and slightly
      effeminate grey beard, unimpeachable gloves, and formal but agreeable
      manners. He was the type of the over-civilized, as Professor Chadd was of
      the uncivilized pedant. His formality and agreeableness did him some
      credit under the circumstances. He had a vast experience of books and a
      considerable experience of the more dilettante fashionable salons. But
      neither branch of knowledge had accustomed him to the spectacle of two
      grey-haired middle-class gentlemen in modern costume throwing themselves
      about like acrobats as a substitute for an after-dinner nap.
    </p>
    <p>
      The professor continued his antics with perfect placidity, but Grant
      stopped abruptly. The doctor had reappeared on the scene, and his shiny
      black eyes, under his shiny black hat, moved restlessly from one of them
      to the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dr Colman,&rdquo; said Basil, turning to him, &ldquo;will you entertain Professor
      Chadd again for a little while? I am sure that he needs you. Mr Bingham,
      might I have the pleasure of a few moments' private conversation? My name
      is Grant.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr Bingham, of the British Museum, bowed in a manner that was respectful
      but a trifle bewildered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Chadd will excuse me,&rdquo; continued Basil easily, &ldquo;if I know my way
      about the house.&rdquo; And he led the dazed librarian rapidly through the back
      door into the parlour.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr Bingham,&rdquo; said Basil, setting a chair for him, &ldquo;I imagine that Miss
      Chadd has told you of this distressing occurrence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She has, Mr Grant,&rdquo; said Bingham, looking at the table with a sort of
      compassionate nervousness. &ldquo;I am more pained than I can say by this
      dreadful calamity. It seems quite heart-rending that the thing should have
      happened just as we have decided to give your eminent friend a position
      which falls far short of his merits. As it is, of course&mdash;really, I
      don't know what to say. Professor Chadd may, of course, retain&mdash;I
      sincerely trust he will&mdash;his extraordinarily valuable intellect. But
      I am afraid&mdash;I am really afraid&mdash;that it would not do to have
      the curator of the Asiatic manuscripts&mdash;er&mdash;dancing about.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have a suggestion to make,&rdquo; said Basil, and sat down abruptly in his
      chair, drawing it up to the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am delighted, of course,&rdquo; said the gentleman from the British Museum,
      coughing and drawing up his chair also.
    </p>
    <p>
      The clock on the mantelpiece ticked for just the moments required for
      Basil to clear his throat and collect his words, and then he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My proposal is this. I do not know that in the strict use of words you
      could altogether call it a compromise, still it has something of that
      character. My proposal is that the Government (acting, as I presume,
      through your Museum) should pay Professor Chadd L800 a year until he stops
      dancing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eight hundred a year!&rdquo; said Mr Bingham, and for the first time lifted his
      mild blue eyes to those of his interlocutor&mdash;and he raised them with
      a mild blue stare. &ldquo;I think I have not quite understood you. Did I
      understand you to say that Professor Chadd ought to be employed, in his
      present state, in the Asiatic manuscript department at eight hundred a
      year?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Grant shook his head resolutely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said firmly. &ldquo;No. Chadd is a friend of mine, and I would say
      anything for him I could. But I do not say, I cannot say, that he ought to
      take on the Asiatic manuscripts. I do not go so far as that. I merely say
      that until he stops dancing you ought to pay him L800 Surely you have some
      general fund for the endowment of research.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr Bingham looked bewildered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I really don't know,&rdquo; he said, blinking his eyes, &ldquo;what you are talking
      about. Do you ask us to give this obvious lunatic nearly a thousand a year
      for life?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not at all,&rdquo; cried Basil, keenly and triumphantly. &ldquo;I never said for
      life. Not at all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What for, then?&rdquo; asked the meek Bingham, suppressing an instinct meekly
      to tear his hair. &ldquo;How long is this endowment to run? Not till his death?
      Till the Judgement day?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Basil, beaming, &ldquo;but just what I said. Till he has stopped
      dancing.&rdquo; And he lay back with satisfaction and his hands in his pockets.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bingham had by this time fastened his eyes keenly on Basil Grant and kept
      them there.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, Mr Grant,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Do I seriously understand you to suggest that
      the Government pay Professor Chadd an extraordinarily high salary simply
      on the ground that he has (pardon the phrase) gone mad? That he should be
      paid more than four good clerks solely on the ground that he is flinging
      his boots about in the back yard?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Precisely,&rdquo; said Grant composedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That this absurd payment is not only to run on with the absurd dancing,
      but actually to stop with the absurd dancing?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One must stop somewhere,&rdquo; said Grant. &ldquo;Of course.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bingham rose and took up his perfect stick and gloves.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is really nothing more to be said, Mr Grant,&rdquo; he said coldly. &ldquo;What
      you are trying to explain to me may be a joke&mdash;a slightly unfeeling
      joke. It may be your sincere view, in which case I ask your pardon for the
      former suggestion. But, in any case, it appears quite irrelevant to my
      duties. The mental morbidity, the mental downfall, of Professor Chadd, is
      a thing so painful to me that I cannot easily endure to speak of it. But
      it is clear there is a limit to everything. And if the Archangel Gabriel
      went mad it would sever his connection, I am sorry to say, with the
      British Museum Library.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was stepping towards the door, but Grant's hand, flung out in dramatic
      warning, arrested him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stop!&rdquo; said Basil sternly. &ldquo;Stop while there is yet time. Do you want to
      take part in a great work, Mr Bingham? Do you want to help in the glory of
      Europe&mdash;in the glory of science? Do you want to carry your head in
      the air when it is bald or white because of the part that you bore in a
      great discovery? Do you want&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bingham cut in sharply:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And if I do want this, Mr Grant&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then,&rdquo; said Basil lightly, &ldquo;your task is easy. Get Chadd L800 a year till
      he stops dancing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With a fierce flap of his swinging gloves Bingham turned impatiently to
      the door, but in passing out of it found it blocked. Dr Colman was coming
      in.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Forgive me, gentlemen,&rdquo; he said, in a nervous, confidential voice, &ldquo;the
      fact is, Mr Grant, I&mdash;er&mdash;have made a most disturbing discovery
      about Mr Chadd.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bingham looked at him with grave eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was afraid so,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Drink, I imagine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Drink!&rdquo; echoed Colman, as if that were a much milder affair. &ldquo;Oh, no,
      it's not drink.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr Bingham became somewhat agitated, and his voice grew hurried and vague.
      &ldquo;Homicidal mania&mdash;&rdquo; he began.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; said the medical man impatiently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thinks he's made of glass,&rdquo; said Bingham feverishly, &ldquo;or says he's God&mdash;or&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Dr Colman sharply; &ldquo;the fact is, Mr Grant, my discovery is of a
      different character. The awful thing about him is&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, go on, sir,&rdquo; cried Bingham, in agony.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The awful thing about him is,&rdquo; repeated Colman, with deliberation, &ldquo;that
      he isn't mad.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not mad!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are quite well-known physical tests of lunacy,&rdquo; said the doctor
      shortly; &ldquo;he hasn't got any of them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But why does he dance?&rdquo; cried the despairing Bingham. &ldquo;Why doesn't he
      answer us? Why hasn't he spoken to his family?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The devil knows,&rdquo; said Dr Colman coolly. &ldquo;I'm paid to judge of lunatics,
      but not of fools. The man's not mad.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What on earth can it mean? Can't we make him listen?&rdquo; said Mr Bingham.
      &ldquo;Can none get into any kind of communication with him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Grant's voice struck in sudden and clear, like a steel bell:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall be very happy,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;to give him any message you like to
      send.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Both men stared at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give him a message?&rdquo; they cried simultaneously. &ldquo;How will you give him a
      message?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Basil smiled in his slow way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you really want to know how I shall give him your message,&rdquo; he began,
      but Bingham cried:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course, of course,&rdquo; with a sort of frenzy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Basil, &ldquo;like this.&rdquo; And he suddenly sprang a foot into the
      air, coming down with crashing boots, and then stood on one leg.
    </p>
    <p>
      His face was stern, though this effect was slightly spoiled by the fact
      that one of his feet was making wild circles in the air.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You drive me to it,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You drive me to betray my friend. And I
      will, for his own sake, betray him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The sensitive face of Bingham took on an extra expression of distress as
      of one anticipating some disgraceful disclosure. &ldquo;Anything painful, of
      course&mdash;&rdquo; he began.
    </p>
    <p>
      Basil let his loose foot fall on the carpet with a crash that struck them
      all rigid in their feeble attitudes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Idiots!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Have you seen the man? Have you looked at James Chadd
      going dismally to and fro from his dingy house to your miserable library,
      with his futile books and his confounded umbrella, and never seen that he
      has the eyes of a fanatic? Have you never noticed, stuck casually behind
      his spectacles and above his seedy old collar, the face of a man who might
      have burned heretics, or died for the philosopher's stone? It is all my
      fault, in a way: I lit the dynamite of his deadly faith. I argued against
      him on the score of his famous theory about language&mdash;the theory that
      language was complete in certain individuals and was picked up by others
      simply by watching them. I also chaffed him about not understanding things
      in rough and ready practice. What has this glorious bigot done? He has
      answered me. He has worked out a system of language of his own (it would
      take too long to explain); he has made up, I say, a language of his own.
      And he has sworn that till people understand it, till he can speak to us
      in this language, he will not speak in any other. And he shall not. I have
      understood, by taking careful notice; and, by heaven, so shall the others.
      This shall not be blown upon. He shall finish his experiment. He shall
      have L800 a year from somewhere till he has stopped dancing. To stop him
      now is an infamous war on a great idea. It is religious persecution.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr Bingham held out his hand cordially.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thank you, Mr Grant,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I hope I shall be able to answer for
      the source of the L800 and I fancy that I shall. Will you come in my cab?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, thank you very much, Mr Bingham,&rdquo; said Grant heartily. &ldquo;I think I
      will go and have a chat with the professor in the garden.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The conversation between Chadd and Grant appeared to be personal and
      friendly. They were still dancing when I left.

    <h2>
      Chapter 6. The Eccentric Seclusion of the Old Lady
    </h2>
    <p>
      The conversation of Rupert Grant had two great elements of interest&mdash;first,
      the long fantasias of detective deduction in which he was engaged, and,
      second, his genuine romantic interest in the life of London. His brother
      Basil said of him: &ldquo;His reasoning is particularly cold and clear, and
      invariably leads him wrong. But his poetry comes in abruptly and leads him
      right.&rdquo; Whether this was true of Rupert as a whole, or no, it was
      certainly curiously supported by one story about him which I think worth
      telling.
    </p>
    <p>
      We were walking along a lonely terrace in Brompton together. The street
      was full of that bright blue twilight which comes about half past eight in
      summer, and which seems for the moment to be not so much a coming of
      darkness as the turning on of a new azure illuminator, as if the earth
      were lit suddenly by a sapphire sun. In the cool blue the lemon tint of
      the lamps had already begun to flame, and as Rupert and I passed them,
      Rupert talking excitedly, one after another the pale sparks sprang out of
      the dusk. Rupert was talking excitedly because he was trying to prove to
      me the nine hundred and ninety-ninth of his amateur detective theories. He
      would go about London, with this mad logic in his brain, seeing a
      conspiracy in a cab accident, and a special providence in a falling fusee.
      His suspicions at the moment were fixed upon an unhappy milkman who walked
      in front of us. So arresting were the incidents which afterwards overtook
      us that I am really afraid that I have forgotten what were the main
      outlines of the milkman's crime. I think it had something to do with the
      fact that he had only one small can of milk to carry, and that of that he
      had left the lid loose and walked so quickly that he spilled milk on the
      pavement. This showed that he was not thinking of his small burden, and
      this again showed that he anticipated some other than lacteal business at
      the end of his walk, and this (taken in conjunction with something about
      muddy boots) showed something else that I have entirely forgotten. I am
      afraid that I derided this detailed revelation unmercifully; and I am
      afraid that Rupert Grant, who, though the best of fellows, had a good deal
      of the sensitiveness of the artistic temperament, slightly resented my
      derision. He endeavoured to take a whiff of his cigar, with the placidity
      which he associated with his profession, but the cigar, I think, was
      nearly bitten through.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear fellow,&rdquo; he said acidly, &ldquo;I'll bet you half a crown that wherever
      that milkman comes to a real stop I'll find out something curious.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My resources are equal to that risk,&rdquo; I said, laughing. &ldquo;Done.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We walked on for about a quarter of an hour in silence in the trail of the
      mysterious milkman. He walked quicker and quicker, and we had some ado to
      keep up with him; and every now and then he left a splash of milk, silver
      in the lamplight. Suddenly, almost before we could note it, he disappeared
      down the area steps of a house. I believe Rupert really believed that the
      milkman was a fairy; for a second he seemed to accept him as having
      vanished. Then calling something to me which somehow took no hold on my
      mind, he darted after the mystic milkman, and disappeared himself into the
      area.
    </p>
    <p>
      I waited for at least five minutes, leaning against a lamp-post in the
      lonely street. Then the milkman came swinging up the steps without his can
      and hurried off clattering down the road. Two or three minutes more
      elapsed, and then Rupert came bounding up also, his face pale but yet
      laughing; a not uncommon contradiction in him, denoting excitement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My friend,&rdquo; he said, rubbing his hands, &ldquo;so much for all your scepticism.
      So much for your philistine ignorance of the possibilities of a romantic
      city. Two and sixpence, my boy, is the form in which your prosaic good
      nature will have to express itself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What?&rdquo; I said incredulously, &ldquo;do you mean to say that you really did find
      anything the matter with the poor milkman?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His face fell.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, the milkman,&rdquo; he said, with a miserable affectation at having
      misunderstood me. &ldquo;No, I&mdash;I&mdash;didn't exactly bring anything home
      to the milkman himself, I&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did the milkman say and do?&rdquo; I said, with inexorable sternness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, to tell the truth,&rdquo; said Rupert, shifting restlessly from one foot
      to another, &ldquo;the milkman himself, as far as merely physical appearances
      went, just said, 'Milk, Miss,' and handed in the can. That is not to say,
      of course, that he did not make some secret sign or some&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I broke into a violent laugh. &ldquo;You idiot,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;why don't you own
      yourself wrong and have done with it? Why should he have made a secret
      sign any more than any one else? You own he said nothing and did nothing
      worth mentioning. You own that, don't you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His face grew grave.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, since you ask me, I must admit that I do. It is possible that the
      milkman did not betray himself. It is even possible that I was wrong about
      him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then come along with you,&rdquo; I said, with a certain amicable anger, &ldquo;and
      remember that you owe me half a crown.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As to that, I differ from you,&rdquo; said Rupert coolly. &ldquo;The milkman's
      remarks may have been quite innocent. Even the milkman may have been. But
      I do not owe you half a crown. For the terms of the bet were, I think, as
      follows, as I propounded them, that wherever that milkman came to a real
      stop I should find out something curious.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;I jolly well have. You just come with me,&rdquo; and
      before I could speak he had turned tail once more and whisked through the
      blue dark into the moat or basement of the house. I followed almost before
      I made any decision.
    </p>
    <p>
      When we got down into the area I felt indescribably foolish literally, as
      the saying is, in a hole. There was nothing but a closed door, shuttered
      windows, the steps down which we had come, the ridiculous well in which I
      found myself, and the ridiculous man who had brought me there, and who
      stood there with dancing eyes. I was just about to turn back when Rupert
      caught me by the elbow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just listen to that,&rdquo; he said, and keeping my coat gripped in his right
      hand, he rapped with the knuckles of his left on the shutters of the
      basement window. His air was so definite that I paused and even inclined
      my head for a moment towards it. From inside was coming the murmur of an
      unmistakable human voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you been talking to somebody inside?&rdquo; I asked suddenly, turning to
      Rupert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I haven't,&rdquo; he replied, with a grim smile, &ldquo;but I should very much
      like to. Do you know what somebody is saying in there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, of course not,&rdquo; I replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I recommend you to listen,&rdquo; said Rupert sharply.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the dead silence of the aristocratic street at evening, I stood a
      moment and listened. From behind the wooden partition, in which there was
      a long lean crack, was coming a continuous and moaning sound which took
      the form of the words: &ldquo;When shall I get out? When shall I get out? Will
      they ever let me out?&rdquo; or words to that effect.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know anything about this?&rdquo; I said, turning upon Rupert very
      abruptly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps you think I am the criminal,&rdquo; he said sardonically, &ldquo;instead of
      being in some small sense the detective. I came into this area two or
      three minutes ago, having told you that I knew there was something funny
      going on, and this woman behind the shutters (for it evidently is a woman)
      was moaning like mad. No, my dear friend, beyond that I do not know
      anything about her. She is not, startling as it may seem, my disinherited
      daughter, or a member of my secret seraglio. But when I hear a human being
      wailing that she can't get out, and talking to herself like a mad woman
      and beating on the shutters with her fists, as she was doing two or three
      minutes ago, I think it worth mentioning, that is all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear fellow,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;I apologize; this is no time for arguing. What
      is to be done?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rupert Grant had a long clasp-knife naked and brilliant in his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;First of all,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;house-breaking.&rdquo; And he forced the blade into
      the crevice of the wood and broke away a huge splinter, leaving a gap and
      glimpse of the dark window-pane inside. The room within was entirely
      unlighted, so that for the first few seconds the window seemed a dead and
      opaque surface, as dark as a strip of slate. Then came a realization
      which, though in a sense gradual, made us step back and catch our breath.
      Two large dim human eyes were so close to us that the window itself seemed
      suddenly to be a mask. A pale human face was pressed against the glass
      within, and with increased distinctness, with the increase of the opening
      came the words:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When shall I get out?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What can all this be?&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rupert made no answer, but lifting his walking-stick and pointing the
      ferrule like a fencing sword at the glass, punched a hole in it, smaller
      and more accurate than I should have supposed possible. The moment he had
      done so the voice spouted out of the hole, so to speak, piercing and
      querulous and clear, making the same demand for liberty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can't you get out, madam?&rdquo; I said, drawing near the hole in some
      perturbation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Get out? Of course I can't,&rdquo; moaned the unknown female bitterly. &ldquo;They
      won't let me. I told them I would be let out. I told them I'd call the
      police. But it's no good. Nobody knows, nobody comes. They could keep me
      as long as they liked only&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I was in the very act of breaking the window finally with my stick,
      incensed with this very sinister mystery, when Rupert held my arm hard,
      held it with a curious, still, and secret rigidity as if he desired to
      stop me, but did not desire to be observed to do so. I paused a moment,
      and in the act swung slightly round, so that I was facing the supporting
      wall of the front door steps. The act froze me into a sudden stillness
      like that of Rupert, for a figure almost as motionless as the pillars of
      the portico, but unmistakably human, had put his head out from between the
      doorposts and was gazing down into the area. One of the lighted lamps of
      the street was just behind his head, throwing it into abrupt darkness.
      Consequently, nothing whatever could be seen of his face beyond one fact,
      that he was unquestionably staring at us. I must say I thought Rupert's
      calmness magnificent. He rang the area bell quite idly, and went on
      talking to me with the easy end of a conversation which had never had any
      beginning. The black glaring figure in the portico did not stir. I almost
      thought it was really a statue. In another moment the grey area was golden
      with gaslight as the basement door was opened suddenly and a small and
      decorous housemaid stood in it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pray excuse me,&rdquo; said Rupert, in a voice which he contrived to make
      somehow or other at once affable and underbred, &ldquo;but we thought perhaps
      that you might do something for the Waifs and Strays. We don't expect&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not here,&rdquo; said the small servant, with the incomparable severity of the
      menial of the non-philanthropic, and slammed the door in our faces.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very sad, very sad&mdash;the indifference of these people,&rdquo; said the
      philanthropist with gravity, as we went together up the steps. As we did
      so the motionless figure in the portico suddenly disappeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, what do you make of that?&rdquo; asked Rupert, slapping his gloves
      together when we got into the street.
    </p>
    <p>
      I do not mind admitting that I was seriously upset. Under such conditions
      I had but one thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't you think,&rdquo; I said a trifle timidly, &ldquo;that we had better tell your
      brother?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, if you like,&rdquo; said Rupert, in a lordly way. &ldquo;He is quite near, as I
      promised to meet him at Gloucester Road Station. Shall we take a cab?
      Perhaps, as you say, it might amuse him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gloucester Road Station had, as if by accident, a somewhat deserted look.
      After a little looking about we discovered Basil Grant with his great head
      and his great white hat blocking the ticket-office window. I thought at
      first that he was taking a ticket for somewhere and being an astonishingly
      long time about it. As a matter of fact, he was discussing religion with
      the booking-office clerk, and had almost got his head through the hole in
      his excitement. When we dragged him away it was some time before he would
      talk of anything but the growth of an Oriental fatalism in modern thought,
      which had been well typified by some of the official's ingenious but
      perverse fallacies. At last we managed to get him to understand that we
      had made an astounding discovery. When he did listen, he listened
      attentively, walking between us up and down the lamp-lit street, while we
      told him in a rather feverish duet of the great house in South Kensington,
      of the equivocal milkman, of the lady imprisoned in the basement, and the
      man staring from the porch. At length he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you're thinking of going back to look the thing up, you must be
      careful what you do. It's no good you two going there. To go twice on the
      same pretext would look dubious. To go on a different pretext would look
      worse. You may be quite certain that the inquisitive gentleman who looked
      at you looked thoroughly, and will wear, so to speak, your portraits next
      to his heart. If you want to find out if there is anything in this without
      a police raid I fancy you had better wait outside. I'll go in and see
      them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His slow and reflective walk brought us at length within sight of the
      house. It stood up ponderous and purple against the last pallor of
      twilight. It looked like an ogre's castle. And so apparently it was.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think it's safe, Basil,&rdquo; said his brother, pausing, a little pale,
      under the lamp, &ldquo;to go into that place alone? Of course we shall be near
      enough to hear if you yell, but these devils might do something&mdash;something
      sudden&mdash;or odd. I can't feel it's safe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know of nothing that is safe,&rdquo; said Basil composedly, &ldquo;except, possibly&mdash;death,&rdquo;
       and he went up the steps and rang at the bell. When the massive
      respectable door opened for an instant, cutting a square of gaslight in
      the gathering dark, and then closed with a bang, burying our friend
      inside, we could not repress a shudder. It had been like the heavy gaping
      and closing of the dim lips of some evil leviathan. A freshening night
      breeze began to blow up the street, and we turned up the collars of our
      coats. At the end of twenty minutes, in which we had scarcely moved or
      spoken, we were as cold as icebergs, but more, I think, from apprehension
      than the atmosphere. Suddenly Rupert made an abrupt movement towards the
      house.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can't stand this,&rdquo; he began, but almost as he spoke sprang back into
      the shadow, for the panel of gold was again cut out of the black house
      front, and the burly figure of Basil was silhouetted against it coming
      out. He was roaring with laughter and talking so loudly that you could
      have heard every syllable across the street. Another voice, or, possibly,
      two voices, were laughing and talking back at him from within.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, no,&rdquo; Basil was calling out, with a sort of hilarious hostility.
      &ldquo;That's quite wrong. That's the most ghastly heresy of all. It's the soul,
      my dear chap, the soul that's the arbiter of cosmic forces. When you see a
      cosmic force you don't like, trick it, my boy. But I must really be off.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come and pitch into us again,&rdquo; came the laughing voice from out of the
      house. &ldquo;We still have some bones unbroken.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thanks very much, I will&mdash;good night,&rdquo; shouted Grant, who had by
      this time reached the street.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good night,&rdquo; came the friendly call in reply, before the door closed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Basil,&rdquo; said Rupert Grant, in a hoarse whisper, &ldquo;what are we to do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The elder brother looked thoughtfully from one of us to the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is to be done, Basil?&rdquo; I repeated in uncontrollable excitement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm not sure,&rdquo; said Basil doubtfully. &ldquo;What do you say to getting some
      dinner somewhere and going to the Court Theatre tonight? I tried to get
      those fellows to come, but they couldn't.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We stared blankly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go to the Court Theatre?&rdquo; repeated Rupert. &ldquo;What would be the good of
      that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good? What do you mean?&rdquo; answered Basil, staring also. &ldquo;Have you turned
      Puritan or Passive Resister, or something? For fun, of course.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, great God in Heaven! What are we going to do, I mean!&rdquo; cried Rupert.
      &ldquo;What about the poor woman locked up in that house? Shall I go for the
      police?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Basil's face cleared with immediate comprehension, and he laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, that,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I'd forgotten that. That's all right. Some mistake,
      possibly. Or some quite trifling private affair. But I'm sorry those
      fellows couldn't come with us. Shall we take one of these green omnibuses?
      There is a restaurant in Sloane Square.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I sometimes think you play the fool to frighten us,&rdquo; I said irritably.
      &ldquo;How can we leave that woman locked up? How can it be a mere private
      affair? How can crime and kidnapping and murder, for all I know, be
      private affairs? If you found a corpse in a man's drawing-room, would you
      think it bad taste to talk about it just as if it was a confounded dado or
      an infernal etching?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Basil laughed heartily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's very forcible,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;As a matter of fact, though, I know it's
      all right in this case. And there comes the green omnibus.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you know it's all right in this ease?&rdquo; persisted his brother
      angrily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear chap, the thing's obvious,&rdquo; answered Basil, holding a return
      ticket between his teeth while he fumbled in his waistcoat pocket. &ldquo;Those
      two fellows never committed a crime in their lives. They're not the kind.
      Have either of you chaps got a halfpenny? I want to get a paper before the
      omnibus comes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, curse the paper!&rdquo; cried Rupert, in a fury. &ldquo;Do you mean to tell me,
      Basil Grant, that you are going to leave a fellow creature in pitch
      darkness in a private dungeon, because you've had ten minutes' talk with
      the keepers of it and thought them rather good men?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good men do commit crimes sometimes,&rdquo; said Basil, taking the ticket out
      of his mouth. &ldquo;But this kind of good man doesn't commit that kind of
      crime. Well, shall we get on this omnibus?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The great green vehicle was indeed plunging and lumbering along the dim
      wide street towards us. Basil had stepped from the curb, and for an
      instant it was touch and go whether we should all have leaped on to it and
      been borne away to the restaurant and the theatre.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Basil,&rdquo; I said, taking him firmly by the shoulder, &ldquo;I simply won't leave
      this street and this house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nor will I,&rdquo; said Rupert, glaring at it and biting his fingers. &ldquo;There's
      some black work going on there. If I left it I should never sleep again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Basil Grant looked at us both seriously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course if you feel like that,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;we'll investigate further.
      You'll find it's all right, though. They're only two young Oxford fellows.
      Extremely nice, too, though rather infected with this pseudo-Darwinian
      business. Ethics of evolution and all that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think,&rdquo; said Rupert darkly, ringing the bell, &ldquo;that we shall enlighten
      you further about their ethics.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And may I ask,&rdquo; said Basil gloomily, &ldquo;what it is that you propose to do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I propose, first of all,&rdquo; said Rupert, &ldquo;to get into this house; secondly,
      to have a look at these nice young Oxford men; thirdly, to knock them
      down, bind them, gag them, and search the house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Basil stared indignantly for a few minutes. Then he was shaken for an
      instant with one of his sudden laughs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor little boys,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;But it almost serves them right for holding
      such silly views, after all,&rdquo; and he quaked again with amusement &ldquo;there's
      something confoundedly Darwinian about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose you mean to help us?&rdquo; said Rupert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes, I'll be in it,&rdquo; answered Basil, &ldquo;if it's only to prevent your
      doing the poor chaps any harm.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was standing in the rear of our little procession, looking indifferent
      and sometimes even sulky, but somehow the instant the door opened he
      stepped first into the hall, glowing with urbanity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So sorry to haunt you like this,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I met two friends outside who
      very much want to know you. May I bring them in?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Delighted, of course,&rdquo; said a young voice, the unmistakable voice of the
      Isis, and I realized that the door had been opened, not by the decorous
      little servant girl, but by one of our hosts in person. He was a short,
      but shapely young gentleman, with curly dark hair and a square, snub-nosed
      face. He wore slippers and a sort of blazer of some incredible college
      purple.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This way,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;mind the steps by the staircase. This house is more
      crooked and old-fashioned than you would think from its snobbish exterior.
      There are quite a lot of odd corners in the place really.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That,&rdquo; said Rupert, with a savage smile, &ldquo;I can quite believe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We were by this time in the study or back parlour, used by the young
      inhabitants as a sitting-room, an apartment littered with magazines and
      books ranging from Dante to detective stories. The other youth, who stood
      with his back to the fire smoking a corncob, was big and burly, with dead
      brown hair brushed forward and a Norfolk jacket. He was that particular
      type of man whose every feature and action is heavy and clumsy, and yet
      who is, you would say, rather exceptionally a gentleman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Any more arguments?&rdquo; he said, when introductions had been effected. &ldquo;I
      must say, Mr Grant, you were rather severe upon eminent men of science
      such as we. I've half a mind to chuck my D.Sc. and turn minor poet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bosh,&rdquo; answered Grant. &ldquo;I never said a word against eminent men of
      science. What I complain of is a vague popular philosophy which supposes
      itself to be scientific when it is really nothing but a sort of new
      religion and an uncommonly nasty one. When people talked about the fall of
      man they knew they were talking about a mystery, a thing they didn't
      understand. Now that they talk about the survival of the fittest they
      think they do understand it, whereas they have not merely no notion, they
      have an elaborately false notion of what the words mean. The Darwinian
      movement has made no difference to mankind, except that, instead of
      talking unphilosophically about philosophy, they now talk unscientifically
      about science.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is all very well,&rdquo; said the big young man, whose name appeared to be
      Burrows. &ldquo;Of course, in a sense, science, like mathematics or the violin,
      can only be perfectly understood by specialists. Still, the rudiments may
      be of public use. Greenwood here,&rdquo; indicating the little man in the
      blazer, &ldquo;doesn't know one note of music from another. Still, he knows
      something. He knows enough to take off his hat when they play 'God save
      the King'. He doesn't take it off by mistake when they play 'Oh, dem
      Golden Slippers'. Just in the same way science&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Here Mr Burrows stopped abruptly. He was interrupted by an argument
      uncommon in philosophical controversy and perhaps not wholly legitimate.
      Rupert Grant had bounded on him from behind, flung an arm round his
      throat, and bent the giant backwards.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Knock the other fellow down, Swinburne,&rdquo; he called out, and before I knew
      where I was I was locked in a grapple with the man in the purple blazer.
      He was a wiry fighter, who bent and sprang like a whalebone, but I was
      heavier and had taken him utterly by surprise. I twitched one of his feet
      from under him; he swung for a moment on the single foot, and then we fell
      with a crash amid the litter of newspapers, myself on top.
    </p>
    <p>
      My attention for a moment released by victory, I could hear Basil's voice
      finishing some long sentence of which I had not heard the beginning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;... wholly, I must confess, unintelligible to me, my dear sir, and I need
      not say unpleasant. Still one must side with one's old friends against the
      most fascinating new ones. Permit me, therefore, in tying you up in this
      antimacassar, to make it as commodious as handcuffs can reasonably be
      while...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I had staggered to my feet. The gigantic Burrows was toiling in the
      garotte of Rupert, while Basil was striving to master his mighty hands.
      Rupert and Basil were both particularly strong, but so was Mr Burrows; how
      strong, we knew a second afterwards. His head was held back by Rupert's
      arm, but a convulsive heave went over his whole frame. An instant after
      his head plunged forward like a bull's, and Rupert Grant was slung head
      over heels, a catherine wheel of legs, on the floor in front of him.
      Simultaneously the bull's head butted Basil in the chest, bringing him
      also to the ground with a crash, and the monster, with a Berserker roar,
      leaped at me and knocked me into the corner of the room, smashing the
      waste-paper basket. The bewildered Greenwood sprang furiously to his feet.
      Basil did the same. But they had the best of it now.
    </p>
    <p>
      Greenwood dashed to the bell and pulled it violently, sending peals
      through the great house. Before I could get panting to my feet, and before
      Rupert, who had been literally stunned for a few moments, could even lift
      his head from the floor, two footmen were in the room. Defeated even when
      we were in a majority, we were now outnumbered. Greenwood and one of the
      footmen flung themselves upon me, crushing me back into the corner upon
      the wreck of the paper basket. The other two flew at Basil, and pinned him
      against the wall. Rupert lifted himself on his elbow, but he was still
      dazed.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the strained silence of our helplessness I heard the voice of Basil
      come with a loud incongruous cheerfulness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now this,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;is what I call enjoying oneself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I caught a glimpse of his face, flushed and forced against the bookcase,
      from between the swaying limbs of my captors and his. To my astonishment
      his eyes were really brilliant with pleasure, like those of a child heated
      by a favourite game.
    </p>
    <p>
      I made several apoplectic efforts to rise, but the servant was on top of
      me so heavily that Greenwood could afford to leave me to him. He turned
      quickly to come to reinforce the two who were mastering Basil. The
      latter's head was already sinking lower and lower, like a leaking ship, as
      his enemies pressed him down. He flung up one hand just as I thought him
      falling and hung on to a huge tome in the bookcase, a volume, I afterwards
      discovered, of St Chrysostom's theology. Just as Greenwood bounded across
      the room towards the group, Basil plucked the ponderous tome bodily out of
      the shelf, swung it, and sent it spinning through the air, so that it
      struck Greenwood flat in the face and knocked him over like a rolling
      ninepin. At the same instant Basil's stiffness broke, and he sank, his
      enemies closing over him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rupert's head was clear, but his body shaken; he was hanging as best he
      could on to the half-prostrate Greenwood. They were rolling over each
      other on the floor, both somewhat enfeebled by their falls, but Rupert
      certainly the more so. I was still successfully held down. The floor was a
      sea of torn and trampled papers and magazines, like an immense waste-paper
      basket. Burrows and his companion were almost up to the knees in them, as
      in a drift of dead leaves. And Greenwood had his leg stuck right through a
      sheet of the Pall Mall Gazette, which clung to it ludicrously, like some
      fantastic trouser frill.
    </p>
    <p>
      Basil, shut from me in a human prison, a prison of powerful bodies, might
      be dead for all I knew. I fancied, however, that the broad back of Mr
      Burrows, which was turned towards me, had a certain bend of effort in it
      as if my friend still needed some holding down. Suddenly that broad back
      swayed hither and thither. It was swaying on one leg; Basil, somehow, had
      hold of the other. Burrows' huge fists and those of the footman were
      battering Basil's sunken head like an anvil, but nothing could get the
      giant's ankle out of his sudden and savage grip. While his own head was
      forced slowly down in darkness and great pain, the right leg of his captor
      was being forced in the air. Burrows swung to and fro with a purple face.
      Then suddenly the floor and the walls and the ceiling shook together, as
      the colossus fell, all his length seeming to fill the floor. Basil sprang
      up with dancing eyes, and with three blows like battering-rams knocked the
      footman into a cocked hat. Then he sprang on top of Burrows, with one
      antimacassar in his hand and another in his teeth, and bound him hand and
      foot almost before he knew clearly that his head had struck the floor.
      Then Basil sprang at Greenwood, whom Rupert was struggling to hold down,
      and between them they secured him easily. The man who had hold of me let
      go and turned to his rescue, but I leaped up like a spring released, and,
      to my infinite satisfaction, knocked the fellow down. The other footman,
      bleeding at the mouth and quite demoralized, was stumbling out of the
      room. My late captor, without a word, slunk after him, seeing that the
      battle was won. Rupert was sitting astride the pinioned Mr Greenwood,
      Basil astride the pinioned Mr Burrows.
    </p>
    <p>
      To my surprise the latter gentleman, lying bound on his back, spoke in a
      perfectly calm voice to the man who sat on top of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now, gentlemen,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;since you have got your own way, perhaps
      you wouldn't mind telling us what the deuce all this is?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This,&rdquo; said Basil, with a radiant face, looking down at his captive,
      &ldquo;this is what we call the survival of the fittest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rupert, who had been steadily collecting himself throughout the latter
      phases of the fight, was intellectually altogether himself again at the
      end of it. Springing up from the prostrate Greenwood, and knotting a
      handkerchief round his left hand, which was bleeding from a blow, he sang
      out quite coolly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Basil, will you mount guard over the captive of your bow and spear and
      antimacassar? Swinburne and I will clear out the prison downstairs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right,&rdquo; said Basil, rising also and seating himself in a leisured way
      in an armchair. &ldquo;Don't hurry for us,&rdquo; he said, glancing round at the
      litter of the room, &ldquo;we have all the illustrated papers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rupert lurched thoughtfully out of the room, and I followed him even more
      slowly; in fact, I lingered long enough to hear, as I passed through the
      room, the passages and the kitchen stairs, Basil's voice continuing
      conversationally:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now, Mr Burrows,&rdquo; he said, settling himself sociably in the chair,
      &ldquo;there's no reason why we shouldn't go on with that amusing argument. I'm
      sorry that you have to express yourself lying on your back on the floor,
      and, as I told you before, I've no more notion why you are there than the
      man in the moon. A conversationalist like yourself, however, can scarcely
      be seriously handicapped by any bodily posture. You were saying, if I
      remember right, when this incidental fracas occurred, that the rudiments
      of science might with advantage be made public.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Precisely,&rdquo; said the large man on the floor in an easy tone. &ldquo;I hold that
      nothing more than a rough sketch of the universe as seen by science can
      be...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And here the voices died away as we descended into the basement. I noticed
      that Mr Greenwood did not join in the amicable controversy. Strange as it
      may appear, I think he looked back upon our proceedings with a slight
      degree of resentment. Mr Burrows, however, was all philosophy and
      chattiness. We left them, as I say, together, and sank deeper and deeper
      into the under-world of that mysterious house, which, perhaps, appeared to
      us somewhat more Tartarean than it really was, owing to our knowledge of
      its semi-criminal mystery and of the human secret locked below.
    </p>
    <p>
      The basement floor had several doors, as is usual in such a house; doors
      that would naturally lead to the kitchen, the scullery, the pantry, the
      servants' hall, and so on. Rupert flung open all the doors with
      indescribable rapidity. Four out of the five opened on entirely empty
      apartments. The fifth was locked. Rupert broke the door in like a bandbox,
      and we fell into the sudden blackness of the sealed, unlighted room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rupert stood on the threshold, and called out like a man calling into an
      abyss:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whoever you are, come out. You are free. The people who held you captive
      are captives themselves. We heard you crying and we came to deliver you.
      We have bound your enemies upstairs hand and foot. You are free.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For some seconds after he had spoken into the darkness there was a dead
      silence in it. Then there came a kind of muttering and moaning. We might
      easily have taken it for the wind or rats if we had not happened to have
      heard it before. It was unmistakably the voice of the imprisoned woman,
      drearily demanding liberty, just as we had heard her demand it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has anybody got a match?&rdquo; said Rupert grimly. &ldquo;I fancy we have come
      pretty near the end of this business.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I struck a match and held it up. It revealed a large, bare, yellow-papered
      apartment with a dark-clad figure at the other end of it near the window.
      An instant after it burned my fingers and dropped, leaving darkness. It
      had, however, revealed something more practical&mdash;an iron gas bracket
      just above my head. I struck another match and lit the gas. And we found
      ourselves suddenly and seriously in the presence of the captive.
    </p>
    <p>
      At a sort of workbox in the window of this subterranean breakfast-room sat
      an elderly lady with a singularly high colour and almost startling silver
      hair. She had, as if designedly to relieve these effects, a pair of
      Mephistophelian black eyebrows and a very neat black dress. The glare of
      the gas lit up her piquant hair and face perfectly against the brown
      background of the shutters. The background was blue and not brown in one
      place; at the place where Rupert's knife had torn a great opening in the
      wood about an hour before.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madam,&rdquo; said he, advancing with a gesture of the hat, &ldquo;permit me to have
      the pleasure of announcing to you that you are free. Your complaints
      happened to strike our ears as we passed down the street, and we have
      therefore ventured to come to your rescue.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The old lady with the red face and the black eyebrows looked at us for a
      moment with something of the apoplectic stare of a parrot. Then she said,
      with a sudden gust or breathing of relief:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rescue? Where is Mr Greenwood? Where is Mr Burrows? Did you say you had
      rescued me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, madam,&rdquo; said Rupert, with a beaming condescension. &ldquo;We have very
      satisfactorily dealt with Mr Greenwood and Mr Burrows. We have settled
      affairs with them very satisfactorily.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The old lady rose from her chair and came very quickly towards us.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did you say to them? How did you persuade them?&rdquo; she cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We persuaded them, my dear madam,&rdquo; said Rupert, laughing, &ldquo;by knocking
      them down and tying them up. But what is the matter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      To the surprise of every one the old lady walked slowly back to her seat
      by the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do I understand,&rdquo; she said, with the air of a person about to begin
      knitting, &ldquo;that you have knocked down Mr Burrows and tied him up?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We have,&rdquo; said Rupert proudly; &ldquo;we have resisted their oppression and
      conquered it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, thanks,&rdquo; answered the old lady, and sat down by the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      A considerable pause followed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The road is quite clear for you, madam,&rdquo; said Rupert pleasantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old lady rose, cocking her black eyebrows and her silver crest at us
      for an instant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what about Greenwood and Burrows?&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;What did I understand
      you to say had become of them?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are lying on the floor upstairs,&rdquo; said Rupert, chuckling. &ldquo;Tied hand
      and foot.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, that settles it,&rdquo; said the old lady, coming with a kind of bang
      into her seat again, &ldquo;I must stop where I am.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rupert looked bewildered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stop where you are?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Why should you stop any longer where you
      are? What power can force you now to stop in this miserable cell?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The question rather is,&rdquo; said the old lady, with composure, &ldquo;what power
      can force me to go anywhere else?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We both stared wildly at her and she stared tranquilly at us both.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last I said, &ldquo;Do you really mean to say that we are to leave you here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose you don't intend to tie me up,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and carry me off? I
      certainly shall not go otherwise.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, my dear madam,&rdquo; cried out Rupert, in a radiant exasperation, &ldquo;we
      heard you with our own ears crying because you could not get out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eavesdroppers often hear rather misleading things,&rdquo; replied the captive
      grimly. &ldquo;I suppose I did break down a bit and lose my temper and talk to
      myself. But I have some sense of honour for all that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some sense of honour?&rdquo; repeated Rupert, and the last light of
      intelligence died out of his face, leaving it the face of an idiot with
      rolling eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      He moved vaguely towards the door and I followed. But I turned yet once
      more in the toils of my conscience and curiosity. &ldquo;Can we do nothing for
      you, madam?&rdquo; I said forlornly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why,&rdquo; said the lady, &ldquo;if you are particularly anxious to do me a little
      favour you might untie the gentlemen upstairs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rupert plunged heavily up the kitchen staircase, shaking it with his vague
      violence. With mouth open to speak he stumbled to the door of the
      sitting-room and scene of battle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Theoretically speaking, that is no doubt true,&rdquo; Mr Burrows was saying,
      lying on his back and arguing easily with Basil; &ldquo;but we must consider the
      matter as it appears to our sense. The origin of morality...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Basil,&rdquo; cried Rupert, gasping, &ldquo;she won't come out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who won't come out?&rdquo; asked Basil, a little cross at being interrupted in
      an argument.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The lady downstairs,&rdquo; replied Rupert. &ldquo;The lady who was locked up. She
      won't come out. And she says that all she wants is for us to let these
      fellows loose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And a jolly sensible suggestion,&rdquo; cried Basil, and with a bound he was on
      top of the prostrate Burrows once more and was unknotting his bonds with
      hands and teeth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A brilliant idea. Swinburne, just undo Mr Greenwood.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In a dazed and automatic way I released the little gentleman in the purple
      jacket, who did not seem to regard any of the proceedings as particularly
      sensible or brilliant. The gigantic Burrows, on the other hand, was
      heaving with herculean laughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Basil, in his cheeriest way, &ldquo;I think we must be getting
      away. We've so much enjoyed our evening. Far too much regard for you to
      stand on ceremony. If I may so express myself, we've made ourselves at
      home. Good night. Thanks so much. Come along, Rupert.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Basil,&rdquo; said Rupert desperately, &ldquo;for God's sake come and see what you
      can make of the woman downstairs. I can't get the discomfort out of my
      mind. I admit that things look as if we had made a mistake. But these
      gentlemen won't mind perhaps...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; cried Burrows, with a sort of Rabelaisian uproariousness. &ldquo;No,
      no, look in the pantry, gentlemen. Examine the coal-hole. Make a tour of
      the chimneys. There are corpses all over the house, I assure you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This adventure of ours was destined to differ in one respect from others
      which I have narrated. I had been through many wild days with Basil Grant,
      days for the first half of which the sun and the moon seemed to have gone
      mad. But it had almost invariably happened that towards the end of the day
      and its adventure things had cleared themselves like the sky after rain,
      and a luminous and quiet meaning had gradually dawned upon me. But this
      day's work was destined to end in confusion worse confounded. Before we
      left that house, ten minutes afterwards, one half-witted touch was added
      which rolled all our minds in cloud. If Rupert's head had suddenly fallen
      off on the floor, if wings had begun to sprout out of Greenwood's
      shoulders, we could scarcely have been more suddenly stricken. And yet of
      this we had no explanation. We had to go to bed that night with the
      prodigy and get up next morning with it and let it stand in our memories
      for weeks and months. As will be seen, it was not until months afterwards
      that by another accident and in another way it was explained. For the
      present I only state what happened.
    </p>
    <p>
      When all five of us went down the kitchen stairs again, Rupert leading,
      the two hosts bringing up the rear, we found the door of the prison again
      closed. Throwing it open we found the place again as black as pitch. The
      old lady, if she was still there, had turned out the gas: she seemed to
      have a weird preference for sitting in the dark.
    </p>
    <p>
      Without another word Rupert lit the gas again. The little old lady turned
      her bird-like head as we all stumbled forward in the strong gaslight.
      Then, with a quickness that almost made me jump, she sprang up and swept a
      sort of old-fashioned curtsey or reverence. I looked quickly at Greenwood
      and Burrows, to whom it was natural to suppose this subservience had been
      offered. I felt irritated at what was implied in this subservience, and
      desired to see the faces of the tyrants as they received it. To my
      surprise they did not seem to have seen it at all: Burrows was paring his
      nails with a small penknife. Greenwood was at the back of the group and
      had hardly entered the room. And then an amazing fact became apparent. It
      was Basil Grant who stood foremost of the group, the golden gaslight
      lighting up his strong face and figure. His face wore an expression
      indescribably conscious, with the suspicion of a very grave smile. His
      head was slightly bent with a restrained bow. It was he who had
      acknowledged the lady's obeisance. And it was he, beyond any shadow of
      reasonable doubt, to whom it had really been directed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So I hear,&rdquo; he said, in a kindly yet somehow formal voice, &ldquo;I hear,
      madam, that my friends have been trying to rescue you. But without
      success.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No one, naturally, knows my faults better than you,&rdquo; answered the lady
      with a high colour. &ldquo;But you have not found me guilty of treachery.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I willingly attest it, madam,&rdquo; replied Basil, in the same level tones,
      &ldquo;and the fact is that I am so much gratified with your exhibition of
      loyalty that I permit myself the pleasure of exercising some very large
      discretionary powers. You would not leave this room at the request of
      these gentlemen. But you know that you can safely leave it at mine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The captive made another reverence. &ldquo;I have never complained of your
      injustice,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I need scarcely say what I think of your
      generosity.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And before our staring eyes could blink she had passed out of the room,
      Basil holding the door open for her.
    </p>
    <p>
      He turned to Greenwood with a relapse into joviality. &ldquo;This will be a
      relief to you,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, it will,&rdquo; replied that immovable young gentleman with a face like a
      sphinx.
    </p>
    <p>
      We found ourselves outside in the dark blue night, shaken and dazed as if
      we had fallen into it from some high tower.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Basil,&rdquo; said Rupert at last, in a weak voice, &ldquo;I always thought you were
      my brother. But are you a man? I mean&mdash;are you only a man?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At present,&rdquo; replied Basil, &ldquo;my mere humanity is proved by one of the
      most unmistakable symbols&mdash;hunger. We are too late for the theatre in
      Sloane Square. But we are not too late for the restaurant. Here comes the
      green omnibus!&rdquo; and he had leaped on it before we could speak. &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      As I said, it was months after that Rupert Grant suddenly entered my room,
      swinging a satchel in his hand and with a general air of having jumped
      over the garden wall, and implored me to go with him upon the latest and
      wildest of his expeditions. He proposed to himself no less a thing than
      the discovery of the actual origin, whereabouts, and headquarters of the
      source of all our joys and sorrows&mdash;the Club of Queer Trades. I
      should expand this story for ever if I explained how ultimately we ran
      this strange entity to its lair. The process meant a hundred interesting
      things. The tracking of a member, the bribing of a cabman, the fighting of
      roughs, the lifting of a paving stone, the finding of a cellar, the
      finding of a cellar below the cellar, the finding of the subterranean
      passage, the finding of the Club of Queer Trades.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have had many strange experiences in my life, but never a stranger one
      than that I felt when I came out of those rambling, sightless, and
      seemingly hopeless passages into the sudden splendour of a sumptuous and
      hospitable dining-room, surrounded upon almost every side by faces that I
      knew. There was Mr Montmorency, the Arboreal House-Agent, seated between
      the two brisk young men who were occasionally vicars, and always
      Professional Detainers. There was Mr P. G. Northover, founder of the
      Adventure and Romance Agency. There was Professor Chadd, who invented the
      dancing Language.
    </p>
    <p>
      As we entered, all the members seemed to sink suddenly into their chairs,
      and with the very action the vacancy of the presidential seat gaped at us
      like a missing tooth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The president's not here,&rdquo; said Mr P. G. Northover, turning suddenly to
      Professor Chadd.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;N&mdash;no,&rdquo; said the philosopher, with more than his ordinary vagueness.
      &ldquo;I can't imagine where he is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good heavens,&rdquo; said Mr Montmorency, jumping up, &ldquo;I really feel a little
      nervous. I'll go and see.&rdquo; And he ran out of the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      An instant after he ran back again, twittering with a timid ecstasy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's there, gentlemen&mdash;he's there all right&mdash;he's coming in
      now,&rdquo; he cried, and sat down. Rupert and I could hardly help feeling the
      beginnings of a sort of wonder as to who this person might be who was the
      first member of this insane brotherhood. Who, we thought indistinctly,
      could be maddest in this world of madmen: what fantastic was it whose
      shadow filled all these fantastics with so loyal an expectation?
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly we were answered. The door flew open and the room was filled and
      shaken with a shout, in the midst of which Basil Grant, smiling and in
      evening dress, took his seat at the head of the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      How we ate that dinner I have no idea. In the common way I am a person
      particularly prone to enjoy the long luxuriance of the club dinner. But on
      this occasion it seemed a hopeless and endless string of courses.
      Hors-d'oeuvre sardines seemed as big as herrings, soup seemed a sort of
      ocean, larks were ducks, ducks were ostriches until that dinner was over.
      The cheese course was maddening. I had often heard of the moon being made
      of green cheese. That night I thought the green cheese was made of the
      moon. And all the time Basil Grant went on laughing and eating and
      drinking, and never threw one glance at us to tell us why he was there,
      the king of these capering idiots.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last came the moment which I knew must in some way enlighten us, the
      time of the club speeches and the club toasts. Basil Grant rose to his
      feet amid a surge of songs and cheers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gentlemen,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;it is a custom in this society that the president
      for the year opens the proceedings not by any general toast of sentiment,
      but by calling upon each member to give a brief account of his trade. We
      then drink to that calling and to all who follow it. It is my business, as
      the senior member, to open by stating my claim to membership of this club.
      Years ago, gentlemen, I was a judge; I did my best in that capacity to do
      justice and to administer the law. But it gradually dawned on me that in
      my work, as it was, I was not touching even the fringe of justice. I was
      seated in the seat of the mighty, I was robed in scarlet and ermine;
      nevertheless, I held a small and lowly and futile post. I had to go by a
      mean rule as much as a postman, and my red and gold was worth no more than
      his. Daily there passed before me taut and passionate problems, the
      stringency of which I had to pretend to relieve by silly imprisonments or
      silly damages, while I knew all the time, by the light of my living common
      sense, that they would have been far better relieved by a kiss or a
      thrashing, or a few words of explanation, or a duel, or a tour in the West
      Highlands. Then, as this grew on me, there grew on me continuously the
      sense of a mountainous frivolity. Every word said in the court, a whisper
      or an oath, seemed more connected with life than the words I had to say.
      Then came the time when I publicly blasphemed the whole bosh, was classed
      as a madman and melted from public life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Something in the atmosphere told me that it was not only Rupert and I who
      were listening with intensity to this statement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I discovered that I could be of no real use. I offered myself
      privately as a purely moral judge to settle purely moral differences.
      Before very long these unofficial courts of honour (kept strictly secret)
      had spread over the whole of society. People were tried before me not for
      the practical trifles for which nobody cares, such as committing a murder,
      or keeping a dog without a licence. My criminals were tried for the faults
      which really make social life impossible. They were tried before me for
      selfishness, or for an impossible vanity, or for scandalmongering, or for
      stinginess to guests or dependents. Of course these courts had no sort of
      real coercive powers. The fulfilment of their punishments rested entirely
      on the honour of the ladies and gentlemen involved, including the honour
      of the culprits. But you would be amazed to know how completely our orders
      were always obeyed. Only lately I had a most pleasing example. A maiden
      lady in South Kensington whom I had condemned to solitary confinement for
      being the means of breaking off an engagement through backbiting,
      absolutely refused to leave her prison, although some well-meaning persons
      had been inopportune enough to rescue her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rupert Grant was staring at his brother, his mouth fallen agape. So, for
      the matter of that, I expect, was I. This, then, was the explanation of
      the old lady's strange discontent and her still stranger content with her
      lot. She was one of the culprits of his Voluntary Criminal Court. She was
      one of the clients of his Queer Trade.
    </p>
    <p>
      We were still dazed when we drank, amid a crash of glasses, the health of
      Basil's new judiciary. We had only a confused sense of everything having
      been put right, the sense men will have when they come into the presence
      of God. We dimly heard Basil say:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr P. G. Northover will now explain the Adventure and Romance Agency.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And we heard equally dimly Northover beginning the statement he had made
      long ago to Major Brown. Thus our epic ended where it had begun, like a
      true cycle.

&ldquo;Defects,&rdquo; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
